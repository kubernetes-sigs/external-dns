What It Does \u00b6 Inspired by Kubernetes DNS , Kubernetes\u2019 cluster-internal DNS server, ExternalDNS makes Kubernetes resources discoverable via public DNS servers. Like KubeDNS, it retrieves a list of resources (Services, Ingresses, etc.) from the Kubernetes API to determine a desired list of DNS records. Unlike KubeDNS, however, it\u2019s not a DNS server itself, but merely configures other DNS providers accordingly\u2014e.g. AWS Route 53 or Google Cloud DNS . In a broader sense, ExternalDNS allows you to control DNS records dynamically via Kubernetes resources in a DNS provider-agnostic way. The FAQ contains additional information and addresses several questions about key concepts of ExternalDNS. To see ExternalDNS in action, have a look at this video or read this blogpost . The Latest Release \u00b6 ExternalDNS allows you to keep selected zones (via --domain-filter ) synchronized with Ingresses and Services of type=LoadBalancer and nodes in various cloud providers: * Google Cloud DNS * AWS Route 53 * AWS Cloud Map * AzureDNS * BlueCat * CloudFlare * RcodeZero * DigitalOcean * DNSimple * Infoblox * Dyn * OpenStack Designate * PowerDNS * CoreDNS * Exoscale * Oracle Cloud Infrastructure DNS * Linode DNS * RFC2136 * NS1 * TransIP * VinylDNS * Vultr * OVH * Scaleway * Akamai Edge DNS * GoDaddy * Gandi * UKFast SafeDNS * IBM Cloud DNS From this release, ExternalDNS can become aware of the records it is managing (enabled via --registry=txt ), therefore ExternalDNS can safely manage non-empty hosted zones. We strongly encourage you to use v0.5 (or greater) with --registry=txt enabled and --txt-owner-id set to a unique value that doesn\u2019t change for the lifetime of your cluster. You might also want to run ExternalDNS in a dry run mode ( --dry-run flag) to see the changes to be submitted to your DNS Provider API. Note that all flags can be replaced with environment variables; for instance, --dry-run could be replaced with EXTERNAL_DNS_DRY_RUN=1 , or --registry txt could be replaced with EXTERNAL_DNS_REGISTRY=txt . Status of providers \u00b6 ExternalDNS supports multiple DNS providers which have been implemented by the ExternalDNS contributors . Maintaining all of those in a central repository is a challenge and we have limited resources to test changes. This means that it is very hard to test all providers for possible regressions and, as written in the Contributing section, we encourage contributors to step in as maintainers for the individual providers and help by testing the integrations. End-to-end testing of ExternalDNS is currently performed in the separate kubernetes-on-aws repository. We define the following stability levels for providers: Stable : Used for smoke tests before a release, used in production and maintainers are active. Beta : Community supported, well tested, but maintainers have no access to resources to execute integration tests on the real platform and/or are not using it in production. Alpha : Community provided with no support from the maintainers apart from reviewing PRs. The following table clarifies the current status of the providers according to the aforementioned stability levels: Provider Status Maintainers Google Cloud DNS Stable AWS Route 53 Stable AWS Cloud Map Beta Akamai Edge DNS Beta AzureDNS Beta BlueCat Alpha @seanmalloy @vinny-sabatini CloudFlare Beta RcodeZero Alpha DigitalOcean Alpha DNSimple Alpha Infoblox Alpha @saileshgiri Dyn Alpha OpenStack Designate Alpha PowerDNS Alpha CoreDNS Alpha Exoscale Alpha Oracle Cloud Infrastructure DNS Alpha Linode DNS Alpha RFC2136 Alpha NS1 Alpha TransIP Alpha VinylDNS Alpha RancherDNS Alpha OVH Alpha Scaleway DNS Alpha @Sh4d1 Vultr Alpha UltraDNS Alpha GoDaddy Alpha Gandi Alpha @packi SafeDNS Alpha @assureddt IBMCloud Alpha @hughhuangzh Kubernetes version compatibility \u00b6 A breaking change was added in external-dns v0.10.0.

Setup Steps \u00b6 Next, run an application and expose it via a Kubernetes Service: kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --port=80 kubectl expose pod nginx --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=LoadBalancer Annotate the Service with your desired external DNS name. Make sure to change example.org to your domain. kubectl annotate service nginx \"external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname=nginx.example.org.\" Optionally, you can customize the TTL value of the resulting DNS record by using the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl annotation: kubectl annotate service nginx \"external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl=10\" For more details on configuring TTL, see here . Use the internal-hostname annotation to create DNS records with ClusterIP as the target. kubectl annotate service nginx \"external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/internal-hostname=nginx.internal.example.org.\" If the service is not of type Loadbalancer you need the \u2013publish-internal-services flag. Locally run a single sync loop of ExternalDNS. external-dns --registry txt --txt-owner-id my-cluster-id --provider google --google-project example-project --source service --once --dry-run This should output the DNS records it will modify to match the managed zone with the DNS records you desire. It also assumes you are running in the default namespace. See the FAQ for more information regarding namespaces. Note: TXT records will have my-cluster-id value embedded. Those are used to ensure that ExternalDNS is aware of the records it manages. Once you\u2019re satisfied with the result, you can run ExternalDNS like you would run it in your cluster: as a control loop, and not in dry-run mode: external-dns --registry txt --txt-owner-id my-cluster-id --provider google --google-project example-project --source service Check that ExternalDNS has created the desired DNS record for your Service and that it points to its load balancer\u2019s IP. Then try to resolve it: dig +short nginx.example.org. 104.155.60.49 Now you can experiment and watch how ExternalDNS makes sure that your DNS records are configured as desired. Here are a couple of things you can try out: * Change the desired hostname by modifying the Service\u2019s annotation. * Recreate the Service and see that the DNS record will be updated to point to the new load balancer IP. * Add another Service to create more DNS records. * Remove Services to clean up your managed zone. The tutorials section contains examples, including Ingress resources, and shows you how to set up ExternalDNS in different environments such as other cloud providers and alternative Ingress controllers. Note \u00b6 If using a txt registry and attempting to use a CNAME the --txt-prefix must be set to avoid conflicts. Changing --txt-prefix will result in lost ownership over previously created records. If externalIPs list is defined for a LoadBalancer service, this list will be used instead of an assigned load balancer IP to create a DNS record. It\u2019s useful when you run bare metal Kubernetes clusters behind NAT or in a similar setup, where a load balancer IP differs from a public IP (e.g. with MetalLB ). Roadmap \u00b6 ExternalDNS was built with extensibility in mind. Adding and experimenting with new DNS providers and sources of desired DNS records should be as easy as possible. It should also be possible to modify how ExternalDNS behaves\u2014e.g. whether it should add records but never delete them. Here\u2019s a rough outline on what is to come (subject to change): v0.1 \u00b6 Support for Google CloudDNS Support for Kubernetes Services v0.2 \u00b6 Support for AWS Route 53 Support for Kubernetes Ingresses v0.3 \u00b6 Support for AWS Route 53 via ALIAS Support for multiple zones Ownership System v0.4 \u00b6 Support for AzureDNS Support for CloudFlare Support for DigitalOcean Multiple DNS names per Service v0.5 \u00b6 Support for creating DNS records to multiple targets (for Google and AWS) Support for OpenStack Designate Support for PowerDNS Support for Linode Support for RcodeZero Support for NS1 Support for TransIP Support for Azure Private DNS v0.6 \u00b6 Ability to replace kOps\u2019 DNS Controller (This could also directly become v1.0 ) Support for OVH v1.0 \u00b6 Ability to replace kOps\u2019 DNS Controller Add support for pod source Add support for DNS Controller annotations for pod and service sources Add support for kOps gossip provider Ability to replace Zalando\u2019s Mate Ability to replace Molecule Software\u2019s route53-kubernetes Yet to be defined \u00b6 Support for CoreDNS Support for record weights Support for different behavioral policies Support for Services with type=NodePort Support for CRDs Support for more advanced DNS record configurations Have a look at the milestones to get an idea of where we currently stand. Contributing \u00b6 Are you interested in contributing to external-dns? We, the maintainers and community, would love your suggestions, contributions, and help! Also, the maintainers can be contacted at any time to learn more about how to get involved. We also encourage ALL active community participants to act as if they are maintainers, even if you don\u2019t have \u201cofficial\u201d write permissions. This is a community effort, we are here to serve the Kubernetes community. If you have an active interest and you want to get involved, you have real power! Don\u2019t assume that the only people who can get things done around here are the \u201cmaintainers\u201d. We also would love to add more \u201cofficial\u201d maintainers, so show us what you can do! The external-dns project is currently in need of maintainers for specific DNS providers. Ideally each provider would have at least two maintainers. It would be nice if the maintainers run the provider in production, but it is not strictly required. Provider listed here that do not have a maintainer listed are in need of assistance.

The projects was started as a Kubernetes Incubator project in February 2017 and being the Kubernetes incubation initiative officially over, the maintainers want to propose the project to be moved to the kubernetes GitHub organization or to kubernetes-sigs, under the sponsorship of sig-network. Motivation \u00b6 ExternalDNS started as a community project with the goal of unifying several existing projects that were trying to solve the same problem: create DNS records for Kubernetes resources on several DNS backends. When the project was proposed (see the original discussion ), there were at least 3 existing implementations of the same functionality: Mate - https://github.com/linki/mate DNS-controller from kops - https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/HEAD/dns-controller Route53-kubernetes - https://github.com/wearemolecule/route53-kubernetes ExternalDNS\u2019 goal from the beginning was to provide an officially supported solution to those problems. After two years of development, the project is still in the kubernetes-sigs. The incubation has been officially discontinued and to quote @thockin \u201cIncubator projects should either become real projects in Kubernetes, shut themselves down, or move elsewhere\u201d (see original thread here ). This KEP proposes to move ExternalDNS to the main Kubernetes organization or kubernetes-sigs. The \u201cProposal\u201d section details the reasons behind it. Goals \u00b6 The only goal of this KEP is to establish consensus regarding the future of the ExternalDNS project and determine where it belongs. Proposal \u00b6 This KEP is about moving External DNS out of the Kubernetes incubator. This section will cover the reasons why External DNS is useful and what the community would miss in case the project would be discontinued or moved under another organization. External DNS\u2026 Is the de facto solution to create DNS records for several Kubernetes resources. Is a vital component to achieve an experience close to a PaaS that many Kubernetes users try to replicate on top of Kubernetes, by allowing to automatically create DNS records for web applications. Supports already 18 different DNS providers including all major public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP). Given that the kubernetes-sigs organization will eventually be shut down, the possible alternatives to moving to be an official Kubernetes project are the following: Shut down the project Move the project elsewhere We believe that those alternatives would result in a worse outcome for the community compared to moving the project to the any of the other official Kubernetes organizations. In fact, shutting down ExternalDNS can cause: The community to rebuild the same solution as already happened multiple times before the project was launched. Currently ExternalDNS is easy to be found, referenced in many articles/tutorials and for that reason not exposed to that risk. Existing users of the projects to be left without a future proof working solution. Moving the ExternalDNS project outside of Kubernetes projects would cause: Problems (re-)establishing user trust which could eventually lead to fragmentation and duplication. It would be hard to establish in which organization the project should be moved to. The most natural would be Zalando\u2019s organization, being the company that put most of the work on the project. While it is possible to assume Zalando\u2019s commitment to open-source, that would be a strategic mistake for the project community and for the Kubernetes ecosystem due to the obvious lack of neutrality. Lack of resources to test, lack of issue management via automation. For those reasons, we propose to move ExternalDNS out of the Kubernetes incubator, to live either under the kubernetes or kubernetes-sigs organization to keep being a vital part of the Kubernetes ecosystem. Details \u00b6 Graduation Criteria \u00b6 ExternalDNS is a two years old project widely used in production by many companies. The implementation for the three major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) is stable, not changing its logic and the project is being used in production by many company using Kubernetes. We have evidence that many companies are using ExternalDNS in production, but it is out of scope for this proposal to collect a comprehensive list of companies. The project was quoted by a number of tutorials on the web, including the official tutorials from AWS . ExternalDNS can\u2019t be consider to be \u201cdone\u201d: while the core functionality has been implemented, there is lack of integration testing and structural changes that are needed. Those are identified in the project roadmap, which is roughly made of the following items: Decoupling of the providers Implementation proposal Development Bug fixing and performance optimization (i.e. rate limiting on cloud providers) Integration testing suite, to be implemented at least for the \u201cstable\u201d providers For those reasons, we consider ExternalDNS to be in Beta state as a project. We believe that once the items mentioned above will be implemented, the project can reach a declared GA status. There are a number of other factors that need to be covered to fully describe the state of the project, including who are the maintainers, the way we release and manage the project and so on. Maintainers \u00b6 The project has the following maintainers: hjacobs Raffo linki njuettner The list of maintainers shrunk over time as people moved out of the original development team (all the team members were working at Zalando at the time of project creation) and the project required less work. The high number of providers contributed to the project pose a maintainability challenge: it is hard to bring the providers forward in terms of functionalities or even test them. The maintainers believe that the plan to transform the current Provider interface from a Go interface to an API will allow for enough decoupling and to hand over the maintenance of those plugins to the contributors themselves, see the risk and mitigations section for further details. Release process, artifacts \u00b6 The project uses the free quota of TravisCI to run tests for the project. The release pipeline for the project is currently fully owned by Zalando. It runs on the internal system of the company (closed source) which external maintainers/users can\u2019t access and that pushes images to the publicly accessible docker registry available at the URL registry.opensource.zalan.do . The docker registry service is provided as best effort with no sort of SLA and the maintainers team openly suggests the users to build and maintain their own docker image based on the provided Dockerfiles. Providing a vanity URL for the docker images was consider a non goal till now, but the community seems to be wanting official images from a GCR domain, similarly to what is available for other parts of official Kubernetes projects. ExternalDNS does not follow a specific release cycle. Releases are made often when there are major contributions (i.e. new providers) or important bug fixes. That said, the default branch is considered stable and can be used as well to build images. Risks and Mitigations \u00b6 The following are risks that were identified: Low number of maintainers: we are currently facing issues keeping up with the number of pull requests and issues giving the low number of maintainers. The list of maintainers already shrunk from 8 maintainers to 4. Issues maintaining community contributed providers: we often lack access to external providers (i.e. InfoBlox, etc.) and this means that we cannot verify the implementations and/or run regression tests that go beyond unit testing. Somewhat low quality of releases due to lack of integration testing. We think that the following actions will constitute appropriate mitigations: Decoupling the providers via an API will allow us to resolve the problem of the providers. Being the project already more than 2 years old and given that there are 18 providers implemented, we possess enough information to define an API that we can be stable in a short timeframe. Once this is stable, the problem of testing the providers can be deferred to be a provider\u2019s responsibility. This will also reduce the scope of External DNS core code, which means that there will be no need for a further increase of the maintaining team. We added integration testing for the main cloud providers to the roadmap for the 1.0 release to make sure that we cover the mostly used ones. We believe that this item should be tackled independently from the decoupling of providers as it would be capable of generating value independently from the result of the decoupling efforts.

After two years of development, the project is still in the kubernetes-sigs. The incubation has been officially discontinued and to quote @thockin \u201cIncubator projects should either become real projects in Kubernetes, shut themselves down, or move elsewhere\u201d (see original thread here ).

This section will cover the reasons why External DNS is useful and what the community would miss in case the project would be discontinued or moved under another organization. External DNS\u2026 Is the de facto solution to create DNS records for several Kubernetes resources. Is a vital component to achieve an experience close to a PaaS that many Kubernetes users try to replicate on top of Kubernetes, by allowing to automatically create DNS records for web applications. Supports already 18 different DNS providers including all major public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP). Given that the kubernetes-sigs organization will eventually be shut down, the possible alternatives to moving to be an official Kubernetes project are the following: Shut down the project Move the project elsewhere We believe that those alternatives would result in a worse outcome for the community compared to moving the project to the any of the other official Kubernetes organizations. In fact, shutting down ExternalDNS can cause: The community to rebuild the same solution as already happened multiple times before the project was launched. Currently ExternalDNS is easy to be found, referenced in many articles/tutorials and for that reason not exposed to that risk. Existing users of the projects to be left without a future proof working solution. Moving the ExternalDNS project outside of Kubernetes projects would cause: Problems (re-)establishing user trust which could eventually lead to fragmentation and duplication. It would be hard to establish in which organization the project should be moved to. The most natural would be Zalando\u2019s organization, being the company that put most of the work on the project. While it is possible to assume Zalando\u2019s commitment to open-source, that would be a strategic mistake for the project community and for the Kubernetes ecosystem due to the obvious lack of neutrality. Lack of resources to test, lack of issue management via automation. For those reasons, we propose to move ExternalDNS out of the Kubernetes incubator, to live either under the kubernetes or kubernetes-sigs organization to keep being a vital part of the Kubernetes ecosystem.","title":"Proposal"},{"location":"20190708-external-dns-incubator/#details","text":"","title":"Details"},{"location":"20190708-external-dns-incubator/#graduation-criteria","text":"ExternalDNS is a two years old project widely used in production by many companies.

The docker registry service is provided as best effort with no sort of SLA and the maintainers team openly suggests the users to build and maintain their own docker image based on the provided Dockerfiles. Providing a vanity URL for the docker images was consider a non goal till now, but the community seems to be wanting official images from a GCR domain, similarly to what is available for other parts of official Kubernetes projects.

The list of maintainers already shrunk from 8 maintainers to 4. Issues maintaining community contributed providers: we often lack access to external providers (i.e. InfoBlox, etc.) and this means that we cannot verify the implementations and/or run regression tests that go beyond unit testing. Somewhat low quality of releases due to lack of integration testing. We think that the following actions will constitute appropriate mitigations: Decoupling the providers via an API will allow us to resolve the problem of the providers. Being the project already more than 2 years old and given that there are 18 providers implemented, we possess enough information to define an API that we can be stable in a short timeframe. Once this is stable, the problem of testing the providers can be deferred to be a provider\u2019s responsibility. This will also reduce the scope of External DNS core code, which means that there will be no need for a further increase of the maintaining team. We added integration testing for the main cloud providers to the roadmap for the 1.0 release to make sure that we cover the mostly used ones. We believe that this item should be tackled independently from the decoupling of providers as it would be capable of generating value independently from the result of the decoupling efforts. With the move to the Kubernetes incubation, we hope that we will be able to access the testing resources of the Kubernetes project. In this way, we hope to decouple the project from the dependency on Zalando\u2019s internal CI tool.

Typically, you expose your deployment to the Internet by creating a Service with type=LoadBalancer . Depending on your environment, this usually assigns a random publicly available endpoint to your service that you can access from anywhere in the world. On Google Kubernetes Engine, this is a public IP address: $ kubectl get svc NAME CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE nginx 10.3.249.226 35.187.104.85 80:32281/TCP 1m But dealing with IPs for service discovery isn\u2019t nice, so you register this IP with your DNS provider under a better name\u2014most likely, one that corresponds to your service name. If the IP changes, you update the DNS record accordingly. Those times are over! ExternalDNS takes care of that last step for you by keeping your DNS records synchronized with your external entry points. ExternalDNS\u2019 usefulness also becomes clear when you use Ingresses to allow external traffic into your cluster. Via Ingress, you can tell Kubernetes to route traffic to different services based on certain HTTP request attributes, e.g. the Host header: $ kubectl get ing NAME HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE entrypoint frontend.example.org,backend.example.org 35.186.250.78 80 1m But there\u2019s nothing that actually makes clients resolve those hostnames to the Ingress\u2019 IP address. Again, you normally have to register each entry with your DNS provider. Only if you\u2019re lucky can you use a wildcard, like in the example above. ExternalDNS can solve this for you as well. Which DNS providers are supported? \u00b6 Please check the provider status table for the list of supported providers and their status. As stated in the README, we are currently looking for stable maintainers for those providers, to ensure that bugfixes and new features will be available for all of those. Which Kubernetes objects are supported? \u00b6 Services exposed via type=LoadBalancer , type=ExternalName and for the hostnames defined in Ingress objects as well as headless hostPort services. An initial effort to support type NodePort was started as of May 2018 and it is in progress at the time of writing. How do I specify a DNS name for my Kubernetes objects? \u00b6 There are three sources of information for ExternalDNS to decide on DNS name. ExternalDNS will pick one in order as listed below: For ingress objects ExternalDNS will create a DNS record based on the hosts specified for the ingress object, as well as the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname annotation. For services ExternalDNS will look for the annotation external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname on the service and use the loadbalancer IP, it also will look for the annotation external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/internal-hostname on the service and use the service IP. For ingresses, you can optionally force ExternalDNS to create records based on either the hosts specified or the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname annotation. This behavior is controlled by setting the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ingress-hostname-source annotation on that ingress to either defined-hosts-only or annotation-only . If compatibility mode is enabled (e.g. --compatibility={mate,molecule} flag), External DNS will parse annotations used by Zalando/Mate, wearemolecule/route53-kubernetes. Compatibility mode with Kops DNS Controller is planned to be added in the future. If --fqdn-template flag is specified, e.g. --fqdn-template={{.Name}}.my-org.com , ExternalDNS will use service/ingress specifications for the provided template to generate DNS name. Can I specify multiple global FQDN templates? \u00b6 Yes, you can. Pass in a comma separated list to --fqdn-template . Beaware this will double (triple, etc) the amount of DNS entries based on how many services, ingresses and so on you have and will get you faster towards the API request limit of your DNS provider. Which Service and Ingress controllers are supported? \u00b6 Regarding Services, we\u2019ll support the OSI Layer 4 load balancers that Kubernetes creates on AWS and Google Kubernetes Engine, and possibly other clusters running on Google Compute Engine. Regarding Ingress, we\u2019ll support: * Google\u2019s Ingress Controller on GKE that integrates with their Layer 7 load balancers (GLBC) * nginx-ingress-controller v0.9.x with a fronting Service * Zalando\u2019s AWS Ingress controller , based on AWS ALBs and Skipper * Traefik * version 1.7, when kubernetes.ingressEndpoint is configured ( kubernetes.ingressEndpoint.useDefaultPublishedService in the Helm chart ) * versions >=2.0, when providers.kubernetesIngress.ingressEndpoint is configured ( providers.kubernetesIngress.publishedService.enabled is set to true in the new Helm chart ) Are other Ingress Controllers supported? \u00b6 For Ingress objects, ExternalDNS will attempt to discover the target hostname of the relevant Ingress Controller automatically. If you are using an Ingress Controller that is not listed above you may have issues with ExternalDNS not discovering Endpoints and consequently not creating any DNS records. As a workaround, it is possible to force create an Endpoint by manually specifying a target host/IP for the records to be created by setting the annotation external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target in the Ingress object. Another reason you may want to override the ingress hostname or IP address is if you have an external mechanism for handling failover across ingress endpoints. Possible scenarios for this would include using keepalived-vip to manage failover faster than DNS TTLs might expire. Note that if you set the target to a hostname, then a CNAME record will be created. In this case, the hostname specified in the Ingress object\u2019s annotation must already exist. (i.e. you have a Service resource for your Ingress Controller with the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname annotation set to the same value.) What about other projects similar to ExternalDNS? \u00b6 ExternalDNS is a joint effort to unify different projects accomplishing the same goals, namely: Kops\u2019 DNS Controller Zalando\u2019s Mate Molecule Software\u2019s route53-kubernetes We strive to make the migration from these implementations a smooth experience. This means that, for some time, we\u2019ll support their annotation semantics in ExternalDNS and allow both implementations to run side-by-side. This enables you to migrate incrementally and slowly phase out the other implementation. How does it work with other implementations and legacy records? \u00b6 ExternalDNS will allow you to opt into any Services and Ingresses that you want it to consider, by an annotation. This way, it can co-exist with other implementations running in the same cluster if they also support this pattern. However, we\u2019ll most likely declare ExternalDNS to be the default implementation. This means that ExternalDNS will consider Services and Ingresses that don\u2019t specifically declare which controller they want to be processed by; this is similar to the ingress.class annotation on GKE. I\u2019m afraid you will mess up my DNS records! \u00b6 Since v0.3, ExternalDNS can be configured to use an ownership registry. When this option is enabled, ExternalDNS will keep track of which records it has control over, and will never modify any records over which it doesn\u2019t have control. This is a fundamental requirement to operate ExternalDNS safely when there might be other actors creating DNS records in the same target space. For now ExternalDNS uses TXT records to label owned records, and there might be other alternatives coming in the future releases. Does anyone use ExternalDNS in production? \u00b6 Yes, multiple companies are using ExternalDNS in production. Zalando, as an example, has been using it in production since its v0.3 release, mostly using the AWS provider. How can we start using ExternalDNS? \u00b6 Check out the following descriptive tutorials on how to run ExternalDNS in GKE and AWS or any other supported provider. Why is ExternalDNS only adding a single IP address in Route 53 on AWS when using the nginx-ingress-controller ? How do I get it to use the FQDN of the ELB assigned to my nginx-ingress-controller Service instead? \u00b6 By default the nginx-ingress-controller assigns a single IP address to an Ingress resource when it\u2019s created. ExternalDNS uses what\u2019s assigned to the Ingress resource, so it too will use this single IP address when adding the record in Route 53. In most AWS deployments, you\u2019ll instead want the Route 53 entry to be the FQDN of the ELB that is assigned to the nginx-ingress-controller Service. To accomplish this, when you create the nginx-ingress-controller Deployment, you need to provide the --publish-service option to the /nginx-ingress-controller executable under args . Once this is deployed new Ingress resources will get the ELB\u2019s FQDN and ExternalDNS will use the same when creating records in Route 53. According to the nginx-ingress-controller docs the value you need to provide --publish-service is: Service fronting the ingress controllers. Takes the form namespace/name. The controller will set the endpoint records on the ingress objects to reflect those on the service. For example if your nginx-ingress-controller Service\u2019s name is nginx-ingress-controller-svc and it\u2019s in the default namespace the start of your resource YAML might look like the following. Note the second to last line. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: nginx-ingress-controller spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: nginx-ingress template: metadata: labels: app: nginx-ingress spec: hostNetwork: false containers: - name: nginx-ingress-controller image: \"gcr.io/google_containers/nginx-ingress-controller:0.9.0-beta.11\" imagePullPolicy: \"IfNotPresent\" args: - /nginx-ingress-controller - --default-backend-service={your-backend-service} - --publish-service=default/nginx-ingress-controller-svc - --configmap={your-configmap} I have a Service/Ingress but it\u2019s ignored by ExternalDNS. Why? \u00b6 ExternalDNS can be configured to only use Services or Ingresses as source. In case Services or Ingresses seem to be ignored in your setup, consider checking how the flag --source was configured when deployed. For reference, see the issue https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/issues/267. I\u2019m using an ELB with TXT registry but the CNAME record clashes with the TXT record. How to avoid this? \u00b6 CNAMEs cannot co-exist with other records, therefore you can use the --txt-prefix flag which makes sure to create a TXT record with a name following the pattern prefix.<CNAME record> . For reference, see the issue https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/issues/262. Can I force ExternalDNS to create CNAME records for ELB/ALB? \u00b6 The default logic is: when a target looks like an ELB/ALB, ExternalDNS will create ALIAS records for it. Under certain circumstances you want to force ExternalDNS to create CNAME records instead. If you want to do that, start ExternalDNS with the --aws-prefer-cname flag. Why should I want to force ExternalDNS to create CNAME records for ELB/ALB? Some motivations of users were: \u201cOur hosted zones records are synchronized with our enterprise DNS. The record type ALIAS is an AWS proprietary record type and AWS allows you to set a DNS record directly on AWS resources. Since this is not a DNS RfC standard and therefore can not be transferred and created in our enterprise DNS. So we need to force CNAME creation instead.\u201d or \u201cIn case of ALIAS if we do nslookup with domain name, it will return only IPs of ELB. So it is always difficult for us to locate ELB in AWS console to which domain is pointing. If we configure it with CNAME it will return exact ELB CNAME, which is more helpful.!\u201d Which permissions do I need when running ExternalDNS on a GCE or GKE node. \u00b6 You need to add either https://www.googleapis.com/auth/ndev.clouddns.readwrite or https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform on your instance group\u2019s scope. What metrics can I get from ExternalDNS and what do they mean? \u00b6 ExternalDNS exposes 2 types of metrics: Sources and Registry errors. Source s are mostly Kubernetes API objects. Examples of source errors may be connection errors to the Kubernetes API server itself or missing RBAC permissions. It can also stem from incompatible configuration in the objects itself like invalid characters, processing a broken fqdnTemplate, etc. Registry errors are mostly Provider errors, unless there\u2019s some coding flaw in the registry package. Provider errors often arise due to accessing their APIs due to network or missing cloud-provider permissions when reading records. When applying a changeset, errors will arise if the changeset applied is incompatible with the current state. In case of an increased error count, you could correlate them with the http_request_duration_seconds{handler=\"instrumented_http\"} metric which should show increased numbers for status codes 4xx (permissions, configuration, invalid changeset) or 5xx (apiserver down). You can use the host label in the metric to figure out if the request was against the Kubernetes API server (Source errors) or the DNS provider API (Registry/Provider errors). Here is the full list of available metrics provided by ExternalDNS: Name Description Type external_dns_controller_last_sync_timestamp_seconds Timestamp of last successful sync with the DNS provider Gauge external_dns_registry_endpoints_total Number of Endpoints in all sources Gauge external_dns_registry_errors_total Number of Registry errors Counter external_dns_source_endpoints_total Number of Endpoints in the registry Gauge external_dns_source_errors_total Number of Source errors Counter external_dns_controller_verified_records Number of DNS A-records that exists both in Gauge source & registry external_dns_registry_a_records Number of A records in registry Gauge external_dns_source_a_records Number of A records in source Gauge How can I run ExternalDNS under a specific GCP Service Account, e.g. to access DNS records in other projects? \u00b6 Have a look at https://github.com/linki/mate/blob/v0.6.2/examples/google/README.md#permissions How do I configure multiple Sources via environment variables? (also applies to domain filters) \u00b6 Separate the individual values via a line break. The equivalent of --source=service --source=ingress would be service\\ningress . However, it can be tricky do define that depending on your environment. The following examples work (zsh): Via docker: $ docker run \\ -e EXTERNAL_DNS_SOURCE = $'service\\ningress' \\ -e EXTERNAL_DNS_PROVIDER = google \\ -e EXTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN_FILTER = $'foo.com\\nbar.com' \\ k8s.gcr.io/external-dns/external-dns:v0.7.6 time=\"2017-08-08T14:10:26Z\" level=info msg=\"config: &{APIServerURL: KubeConfig: Sources:[service ingress] Namespace: ...

The internal one should provision hostnames used on the internal network (perhaps inside a VPC), and the external one to expose DNS to the internet. To do this with ExternalDNS you can use the --annotation-filter to specifically tie an instance of ExternalDNS to an instance of an ingress controller. Let\u2019s assume you have two ingress controllers nginx-internal and nginx-external then you can start two ExternalDNS providers one with --annotation-filter=kubernetes.io/ingress.class in (nginx-internal) and one with --annotation-filter=kubernetes.io/ingress.class in (nginx-external) . If you need to search for multiple values of said annotation, you can provide a comma separated list, like so: --annotation-filter=kubernetes.io/ingress.class in (nginx-internal, alb-ingress-internal) . Beware when using multiple sources, e.g. --source=service --source=ingress , --annotation-filter will filter every given source objects. If you need to filter only one specific source you have to run a separated external dns service containing only the wanted --source and --annotation-filter . Note: Filtering based on annotation means that the external-dns controller will receive all resources of that kind and then filter on the client-side. In larger clusters with many resources which change frequently this can cause performance issues. If only some resources need to be managed by an instance of external-dns then label filtering can be used instead of annotation filtering. This means that only those resources which match the selector specified in --label-filter will be passed to the controller. How do I specify that I want the DNS record to point to either the Node\u2019s public or private IP when it has both? \u00b6 If your Nodes have both public and private IP addresses, you might want to write DNS records with one or the other. For example, you may want to write a DNS record in a private zone that resolves to your Nodes\u2019 private IPs so that traffic never leaves your private network. To accomplish this, set this annotation on your service: external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/access=private Conversely, to force the public IP: external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/access=public If this annotation is not set, and the node has both public and private IP addresses, then the public IP will be used by default. Can external-dns manage(add/remove) records in a hosted zone which is setup in different AWS account? \u00b6 Yes, give it the correct cross-account/assume-role permissions and use the --aws-assume-role flag https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/pull/524#issue-181256561 How do I provide multiple values to the annotation external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname ? \u00b6 Separate them by , . Are there official Docker images provided? \u00b6 When we tag a new release, we push a container image to the Kubernetes projects official container registry with the following name: k8s.gcr.io/external-dns/external-dns As tags, you use the external-dns release of choice(i.e. v0.7.6 ). A latest tag is not provided in the container registry. If you wish to build your own image, you can use the provided Dockerfile as a starting point. Which architectures are supported? \u00b6 From v0.7.5 on we support amd64 , arm32v7 and arm64v8 . This means that you can run ExternalDNS on a Kubernetes cluster backed by Rasperry Pis or on ARM instances in the cloud as well as more traditional machines backed by amd64 compatible CPUs. Which operating systems are supported? \u00b6 At the time of writing we only support GNU/linux and we have no plans of supporting Windows or other operating systems. Why am I seeing time out errors even though I have connectivity to my cluster? \u00b6 If you\u2019re seeing an error such as this: FATA[0060] failed to sync cache: timed out waiting for the condition You may not have the correct permissions required to query all the necessary resources in your kubernetes cluster. Specifically, you may be running in a namespace that you don\u2019t have these permissions in. By default, commands are run against the default namespace.

Typically, you expose your deployment to the Internet by creating a Service with type=LoadBalancer . Depending on your environment, this usually assigns a random publicly available endpoint to your service that you can access from anywhere in the world. On Google Kubernetes Engine, this is a public IP address: $ kubectl get svc NAME CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE nginx 10.3.249.226 35.187.104.85 80:32281/TCP 1m But dealing with IPs for service discovery isn\u2019t nice, so you register this IP with your DNS provider under a better name\u2014most likely, one that corresponds to your service name. If the IP changes, you update the DNS record accordingly. Those times are over! ExternalDNS takes care of that last step for you by keeping your DNS records synchronized with your external entry points. ExternalDNS\u2019 usefulness also becomes clear when you use Ingresses to allow external traffic into your cluster. Via Ingress, you can tell Kubernetes to route traffic to different services based on certain HTTP request attributes, e.g. the Host header: $ kubectl get ing NAME HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE entrypoint frontend.example.org,backend.example.org 35.186.250.78 80 1m But there\u2019s nothing that actually makes clients resolve those hostnames to the Ingress\u2019 IP address.

For services ExternalDNS will look for the annotation external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname on the service and use the loadbalancer IP, it also will look for the annotation external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/internal-hostname on the service and use the service IP. For ingresses, you can optionally force ExternalDNS to create records based on either the hosts specified or the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname annotation.

In most AWS deployments, you\u2019ll instead want the Route 53 entry to be the FQDN of the ELB that is assigned to the nginx-ingress-controller Service. To accomplish this, when you create the nginx-ingress-controller Deployment, you need to provide the --publish-service option to the /nginx-ingress-controller executable under args .

They implement the Source interface that has a single method Endpoints which returns the represented source\u2019s objects converted to Endpoints . Endpoints are just a tuple of DNS name and target where target can be an IP or another hostname. For example, the ServiceSource returns all Services converted to Endpoints where the hostname is the value of the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname annotation and the target is the IP of the load balancer or where the hostname is the value of the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/internal-hostname annotation and the target is the IP of the service CLusterIP. This list of endpoints is passed to the Plan which determines the difference between the current DNS records and the desired list of Endpoints . Once the difference has been figured out the list of intended changes is passed to a Registry which live in the registry package. The registry is a wrapper and access point to DNS provider. Registry implements the ownership concept by marking owned records and filtering out records not owned by ExternalDNS before passing them to DNS provider. The provider is the adapter to the DNS provider, e.g. Google Cloud DNS. It implements two methods: ApplyChanges to apply a set of changes filtered by Registry and Records to retrieve the current list of records from the DNS provider. The orchestration between the different components is controlled by the controller . You can pick which Source and Provider to use at runtime via the --source and --provider flags, respectively. Adding a DNS Provider \u00b6 A typical way to start on, e.g. a CoreDNS provider, would be to add a coredns.go to the providers package and implement the interface methods. Then you would have to register your provider under a name in main.go , e.g. coredns , and would be able to trigger it\u2019s functions via setting --provider=coredns . Note, how your provider doesn\u2019t need to know anything about where the DNS records come from, nor does it have to figure out the difference between the current and the desired state, it merely executes the actions calculated by the plan.

They implement the Source interface that has a single method Endpoints which returns the represented source\u2019s objects converted to Endpoints . Endpoints are just a tuple of DNS name and target where target can be an IP or another hostname. For example, the ServiceSource returns all Services converted to Endpoints where the hostname is the value of the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname annotation and the target is the IP of the load balancer or where the hostname is the value of the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/internal-hostname annotation and the target is the IP of the service CLusterIP. This list of endpoints is passed to the Plan which determines the difference between the current DNS records and the desired list of Endpoints . Once the difference has been figured out the list of intended changes is passed to a Registry which live in the registry package. The registry is a wrapper and access point to DNS provider. Registry implements the ownership concept by marking owned records and filtering out records not owned by ExternalDNS before passing them to DNS provider. The provider is the adapter to the DNS provider, e.g. Google Cloud DNS. It implements two methods: ApplyChanges to apply a set of changes filtered by Registry and Records to retrieve the current list of records from the DNS provider. The orchestration between the different components is controlled by the controller .

So far the connection between k8s resources (ingress/services) and DNS records were not streamlined. This proposal aims to make the connection explicit, making k8s resources acquire or release certain DNS names. As long as the resource ingress/service owns the record it can have multiple targets enable iff they are specified in the same resource. Use cases \u00b6 See https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/issues/239 Current behaviour \u00b6 (as of the moment of writing) Central piece of enabling multi-target is having consistent and correct behaviour in plan component in regards to how endpoints generated from kubernetes resources are mapped to dns records. Current implementation of the plan has inconsistent behaviour in the following scenarios, all of which must be resolved before multi-target support can be enabled in the provider implementations: No records registered so far. Two different ingresses request same hostname but different targets, e.g. Ingress A: example.com -> 1.1.1.1 and Ingress B: example.com -> 2.2.2.2 Current Behaviour : both are added to the \u201cCreate\u201d (records to be created) list and passed to Provider Expected Behaviour : only one (random/ or according to predefined strategy) should be chosen and passed to Provider NOTE : while this seems to go against multi-target support, this is done so no other resource can \u201chijack\u201d already created DNS record. Multi targets are supported only on per single resource basis Now let\u2019s say Ingress A was chosen and successfully created, but both ingress A and B are still there. So on next iteration ExternalDNS would see both again in the Desired list. Current Behaviour : DNS record target will change to that of Ingress B. Expected Behaviour : Ingress A should stay unchanged. Ingress B record is not created DNS record for Ingress A was created but its target has changed. Ingress B is still there Current Behaviour : Undetermined behaviour based on which ingress will be parsed last. Expected Behaviour : DNS record should point to the new target specified in A. Ingress B should still be ignored. NOTE : both 2. and 3. can be resolved if External DNS is aware which resource has already acquired DNS record Ingress C has multiple targets: 1.1.1.1 and 2.2.2.2 Current Behaviour : Both targets are split into different endpoints and we end up in one of the cases above Expected Behaviour : Endpoint should contain list of targets and treated as one ingress object. Requirements and assumptions \u00b6 For this feature to work we have to make sure that: DNS records are now owned by certain ingress/service resources. For External DNS it would mean that TXT records now should store back-reference for the resource this record was created for, i.e. \"heritage=external-dns,external-dns/resource=ingress/default/my-ingress-object-name\" DNS records are updated only: If owning resource target list has changed If owning resource record is not found in the desired list (meaning it was deleted), therefore it will now be owned by another record. So its target list will be updated Changes related to other record properties (e.g. TTL) All of the issues described in Current Behaviour sections are resolved Once Create/Update/Delete lists are calculated correctly (this is where conflicts based on requested DNS names are resolved) they are passed to provider , where provider specific implementation will decide how to convert the structures into required formats. If DNS provider does not (or partially) support multi targets then it is up to the provider to make sure that the change list of records passed to the DNS provider API is valid.

Why we need it? DNS provider (AWS Route53, Google DNS, etc.) stores dns records which are created via various means. Integration of External-DNS should be safe and should not delete or overwrite the records which it is not responsible for. Moreover, it should certainly be possible for multiple kubernetes clusters to share the same hosted zone within the dns provider, additionally multiple external-dns instances inside the same cluster should be able to co-exist without messing with the same set of records. Registry provides a mechanism to ensure the safe management of DNS records This proposal introduces multiple possible implementation with the details depending on the setup. Requirements and assumptions \u00b6 Pre-existing records should not be modified by external-dns External-dns instance only creates/modifies/deletes records which are created by this instance It should be possible to transfer the ownership to another external-dns instance Any integrated DNS provider should provide at least a single way to implement the registry Noop registry can be used to disable ownership Lifetime of the records should not be limited to lifetime of external-dns External-dns should have its identifier for marking the managed records - owner-id Types of registry \u00b6 The following presents two ways to implement the registry, and we are planning to implement both for compatibility purposes. TXT records \u00b6 This implementation idea is borrowed from Mate Each record created by external-dns is accompanied by the TXT record, which internally stores the external-dns identifier. For example, if external dns with owner-id=\"external-dns-1\" record to be created with dns name foo.zone.org , external-dns will create a TXT record with the same dns name <record_type>-foo.zone.org and injected value of \"external-dns-1\" . The transfer of ownership can be done by modifying the value of the TXT record. If no TXT record exists for the record or the value does not match its own owner-id , then external-dns will simply ignore it. Goods \u00b6 Easy to guarantee cross-cluster ownership safety Data lifetime is not limited to cluster or external-dns lifetime Supported by major DNS providers TXT record are created alongside other records in a batch request. Hence eliminating possibility of having inconsistent ownership information and dns provider state Bads \u00b6 TXT record cannot co-exist with CNAME records (this can be solved by creating a TXT record with another domain name, e.g. foo.org->foo.txt.org ) Introduces complexity to the logic Difficult to do the transfer of ownership Too easy to mess up with manual modifications ConfigMap \u00b6 This implementation cannot be considered 100% error free , hence use with caution [see Possible failure scenario below] Store the state in the configmap. ConfigMap is created and managed by each external-dns individually, i.e. external-dns with owner-id=external-dns-1 will create and operate on extern-dns-1-registry ConfigMap. ConfigMap will store all the records present in the DNS provider as serialized JSON. For example: kind: ConfigMap apiVersion: v1 metadata: creationTimestamp: 2016-03-09T19:14:38Z name: external-dns-1-storage namespace: same-as-external-dns-1 data: records: \"[{ \\\"dnsname\\\": \\\"foo.org\\\", \\\"owner\\\": \\\"external-dns-1\\\", \\\"target\\\": \\\"loadbalancer1.com\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"A\\\" }, { \\\"dnsname\\\": \\\"bar.org\\\", \\\"owner\\\": \\\"external-dns-2\\\", \\\"target\\\": \\\"loadbalancer2.com\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"A\\\" }, { \\\"dnsname\\\": \\\"unmanaged.org\\\", \\\"owner\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"target\\\": \\\"loadbalancer2.com\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"CNAME\\\" }]\" ConfigMap will be periodically resynced with the dns provider by fetching the dns records and comparing it with the data currently stored and hence rebuilding the ownership information. Goods \u00b6 Not difficult to implement and easy to do the ownership transfer ConfigMap is a first class citizen in kubernetes world Does not create dependency/restriction on DNS provider Cannot be easily messed with by other parties Bads \u00b6 ConfigMap might be out of sync with dns provider state LifeTime is obviously limited to the cluster lifetime Not supported in older kubernetes clusters Bloated ConfigMap - cannot be paginated and will grow very big on DNS provider with thousands of records Failure scenario \u00b6 It is possible that the configmap will go out of sync with the dns provider state. In the implementation flow external-dns will first modify records on dns provider side to subsequently update configmap. And if ExternalDNS will crash in-between two operation created records will be left unmanaged and not viable for update/deletion by External DNS. Component integration \u00b6 Components: * Source - all endpoints ( collection of ingress, service[type=LoadBalancer] etc.) * Plan - object responsible for the create of change lists in external-dns * Provider - interface to access the DNS provider API Registry will serve as wrapper around Provider providing additional information regarding endpoint ownership. Ownership will further taken into account by Plan to filter out records to include only records managed by current ExternalDNS instance (having same owner-id value) A single loop iteration of external-dns operation: Get all endpoints ( collection ingress, service[type=LoadBalancer] etc.) into collection of endpoints Get registry Records() (makes the call to DNSProvider and also build ownership information) Pass Records (including ownership information) and list of endpoints to Plan to do the calculation Call registry ApplyChanges() method (which subsequently calls DNS Provider Apply method to update records) If ConfigMap implementation of Registry is used, then ConfigMap needs to be updated separately In case of configmap, Registry gets updated all the time via Poll . Plan does not call DNS provider directly. Good value of the Poll is to have simple rate limiting mechanism on DNS provider.

Specify the source=ingress argument so that ExternalDNS will look for hostnames in Ingress objects. In addition, you may wish to limit which Ingress objects are used as an ExternalDNS source via the ingress-class argument, but this is not required. For help setting up the ALB Ingress Controller, follow the Setup Guide . Note that the ALB ingress controller uses the same tags for subnet auto-discovery as Kubernetes does with the AWS cloud provider. In the examples that follow, it is assumed that you configured the ALB Ingress Controller with the ingress-class=alb argument (not to be confused with the same argument to ExternalDNS) so that the controller will only respect Ingress objects with the kubernetes.io/ingress.class annotation set to \u201calb\u201d. Deploy an example application \u00b6 Create the following sample \u201cechoserver\u201d application to demonstrate how ExternalDNS works with ALB ingress objects. apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : echoserver spec : replicas : 1 selector : matchLabels : app : echoserver template : metadata : labels : app : echoserver spec : containers : - image : gcr.io/google_containers/echoserver:1.4 imagePullPolicy : Always name : echoserver ports : - containerPort : 8080 --- apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : name : echoserver spec : ports : - port : 80 targetPort : 8080 protocol : TCP type : NodePort selector : app : echoserver Note that the Service object is of type NodePort . We don\u2019t need a Service of type LoadBalancer here, since we will be using an Ingress to create an ALB. Ingress examples \u00b6 Create the following Ingress to expose the echoserver application to the Internet. apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1 kind : Ingress metadata : annotations : alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme : internet-facing kubernetes.io/ingress.class : alb name : echoserver spec : ingressClassName : alb rules : - host : echoserver.mycluster.example.org http : &echoserver_root paths : - path : / backend : service : name : echoserver port : number : 80 pathType : Prefix - host : echoserver.example.org http : *echoserver_root The above should result in the creation of an (ipv4) ALB in AWS which will forward traffic to the echoserver application. If the source=ingress argument is specified, then ExternalDNS will create DNS records based on the hosts specified in ingress objects. The above example would result in two alias records being created, echoserver.mycluster.example.org and echoserver.example.org , which both alias the ALB that is associated with the Ingress object. Note that the above example makes use of the YAML anchor feature to avoid having to repeat the http section for multiple hosts that use the exact same paths. If this Ingress object will only be fronting one backend Service, we might instead create the following: apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1 kind : Ingress metadata : annotations : alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme : internet-facing external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname : echoserver.mycluster.example.org, echoserver.example.org kubernetes.io/ingress.class : alb name : echoserver spec : ingressClassName : alb rules : - http : paths : - path : / backend : service : name : echoserver port : number : 80 pathType : Prefix In the above example we create a default path that works for any hostname, and make use of the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname annotation to create multiple aliases for the resulting ALB. Dualstack ALBs \u00b6 AWS supports both IPv4 and \u201cdualstack\u201d (both IPv4 and IPv6) interfaces for ALBs. The ALB ingress controller uses the alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ip-address-type annotation (which defaults to ipv4 ) to determine this. If this annotation is set to dualstack then ExternalDNS will create two alias records (one A record and one AAAA record) for each hostname associated with the Ingress object. Example: apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1 kind : Ingress metadata : annotations : alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme : internet-facing alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ip-address-type : dualstack kubernetes.io/ingress.class : alb name : echoserver spec : ingressClassName : alb rules : - host : echoserver.example.org http : paths : - path : / backend : service : name : echoserver port : number : 80 pathType : Prefix The above Ingress object will result in the creation of an ALB with a dualstack interface. ExternalDNS will create both an A echoserver.example.org record and an AAAA record of the same name, that each are aliases for the same ALB.","title":"Using ExternalDNS with alb-ingress-controller"},{"location":"tutorials/alb-ingress/#using-externaldns-with-alb-ingress-controller","text":"This tutorial describes how to use ExternalDNS with the aws-alb-ingress-controller .","title":"Using ExternalDNS with alb-ingress-controller"},{"location":"tutorials/alb-ingress/#setting-up-externaldns-and-aws-alb-ingress-controller","text":"Follow the AWS tutorial to setup ExternalDNS for use in Kubernetes clusters running in AWS.

You\u2019ll want to create this Policy in IAM first. In our example, we\u2019ll call the policy AllowExternalDNSUpdates (but you can call it whatever you prefer).

Note the role name; you\u2019ll need to refer to it in the K8S manifest below. Attach the AllowExternalDNSUpdates IAM Policy (above) to the role. The trust relationship associated with the IAM Role will vary depending on how you\u2019ve configured your Kubernetes cluster: Amazon EKS \u00b6 If your EKS-managed cluster is >= 1.13 and was created after 2019-09-04, refer to the Amazon EKS documentation for instructions on how to create the IAM Role. Otherwise, you will need to use kiam or kube2iam or set the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY on the deployment. kiam \u00b6 If you\u2019re using kiam , follow the instructions for creating the IAM role. kube2iam \u00b6 If you\u2019re using kube2iam , follow the instructions for creating the IAM Role. EC2 Instance Role (not recommended) \u00b6 WARNING: This will grant all pods on the node the ability to manipulate Route 53 Resource Record Sets. If exploited by an attacker, this could lead to a serious security and/or availability incident. For this reason, it is not recommended. Create an IAM Role for your EC2 instances as described in the Amazon EC2 documentation . Then, attach the associated Instance Profile to the EC2 instances that comprise your K8S cluster. For this method to work, you must permit your pods the ability to access the EC2 instance metadata service (169.254.169.254). This is allowed by default. Set up a hosted zone \u00b6 If you prefer to try-out ExternalDNS in one of the existing hosted-zones you can skip this step Create a DNS zone which will contain the managed DNS records. $ aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name \"external-dns-test.my-org.com.\" --caller-reference \"external-dns-test- $( date +%s ) \" Make a note of the ID of the hosted zone you just created, which will serve as the value for my-hostedzone-identifier. $ aws route53 list-hosted-zones-by-name --output json --dns-name \"external-dns-test.my-org.com.\" | jq -r '.HostedZones[0].Id' /hostedzone/ZEWFWZ4R16P7IB Make a note of the nameservers that were assigned to your new zone. $ aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --output json --hosted-zone-id \"/hostedzone/ZEWFWZ4R16P7IB\" \\ --query \"ResourceRecordSets[?Type == 'NS']\" | jq -r '.[0].ResourceRecords[].Value' ns-5514.awsdns-53.org. ...

To make the target an alias, the ingress needs to be configured correctly as described in the docs . In particular, the argument --publish-service=default/nginx-ingress-controller has to be set on the nginx-ingress-controller container. If one uses the nginx-ingress Helm chart, this flag can be set with the controller.publishService.enabled configuration option. Verify ExternalDNS works (Ingress example) \u00b6 Create an ingress resource manifest file. For ingress objects ExternalDNS will create a DNS record based on the host specified for the ingress object. apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1 kind : Ingress metadata : name : foo annotations : kubernetes.io/ingress.class : \"nginx\" # use the one that corresponds to your ingress controller. spec : rules : - host : foo.bar.com http : paths : - backend : service : name : foo port : number : 80 pathType : Prefix Verify ExternalDNS works (Service example) \u00b6 Create the following sample application to test that ExternalDNS works. For services ExternalDNS will look for the annotation external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname on the service and use the corresponding value. If you want to give multiple names to service, you can set it to external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname with a comma separator. apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : name : nginx annotations : external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname : nginx.external-dns-test.my-org.com spec : type : LoadBalancer ports : - port : 80 name : http targetPort : 80 selector : app : nginx --- apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : nginx spec : selector : matchLabels : app : nginx template : metadata : labels : app : nginx spec : containers : - image : nginx name : nginx ports : - containerPort : 80 name : http After roughly two minutes check that a corresponding DNS record for your service was created. $ aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --output json --hosted-zone-id \"/hostedzone/ZEWFWZ4R16P7IB\" \\ --query \"ResourceRecordSets[?Name == 'nginx.external-dns-test.my-org.com.']|[?Type == 'A']\" [ { \"AliasTarget\": { \"HostedZoneId\": \"ZEWFWZ4R16P7IB\", \"DNSName\": \"ae11c2360188411e7951602725593fd1-1224345803.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com.\", \"EvaluateTargetHealth\": true }, \"Name\": \"external-dns-test.my-org.com.\", \"Type\": \"A\" }, { \"Name\": \"external-dns-test.my-org.com\", \"TTL\": 300, \"ResourceRecords\": [ { \"Value\": \"\\\"heritage=external-dns,external-dns/owner=my-hostedzone-identifier\\\"\" } ], \"Type\": \"TXT\" } ] Note created TXT record alongside ALIAS record. TXT record signifies that the corresponding ALIAS record is managed by ExternalDNS. This makes ExternalDNS safe for running in environments where there are other records managed via other means. Let\u2019s check that we can resolve this DNS name. We\u2019ll ask the nameservers assigned to your zone first. $ dig +short @ns-5514.awsdns-53.org. nginx.external-dns-test.my-org.com. ae11c2360188411e7951602725593fd1-1224345803.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com. If you hooked up your DNS zone with its parent zone correctly you can use curl to access your site. $ curl nginx.external-dns-test.my-org.com. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Welcome to nginx!</title> ... </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Ingress objects on AWS require a separately deployed Ingress controller which we\u2019ll describe in another tutorial. Custom TTL \u00b6 The default DNS record TTL (Time-To-Live) is 300 seconds. You can customize this value by setting the annotation external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl . e.g., modify the service manifest YAML file above: apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : name : nginx annotations : external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname : nginx.external-dns-test.my-org.com external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl : \"60\" spec : ... This will set the DNS record\u2019s TTL to 60 seconds. Routing policies \u00b6 Route53 offers different routing policies . The routing policy for a record can be controlled with the following annotations: external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/set-identifier : this needs to be set to use any of the following routing policies For any given DNS name, only one of the following routing policies can be used: Weighted records: external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/aws-weight Latency-based routing: external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/aws-region Failover: external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/aws-failover Geolocation-based routing: external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/aws-geolocation-continent-code external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/aws-geolocation-country-code external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/aws-geolocation-subdivision-code Multi-value answer: external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/aws-multi-value-answer Associating DNS records with healthchecks \u00b6 You can configure Route53 to associate DNS records with healthchecks for automated DNS failover using external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/aws-health-check-id: <health-check-id> annotation. Note: ExternalDNS does not support creating healthchecks, and assumes that <health-check-id> already exists. Govcloud caveats \u00b6 Due to the special nature with how Route53 runs in Govcloud, there are a few tweaks in the deployment settings. An Environment variable with name of AWS_REGION set to either us-gov-west-1 or us-gov-east-1 is required. Otherwise it tries to lookup a region that does not exist in Govcloud and it errors out. env : - name : AWS_REGION value : us-gov-west-1 Route53 in Govcloud does not allow aliases. Therefore, container args must be set so that it uses CNAMES and a txt-prefix must be set to something. Otherwise, it will try to create a TXT record with the same value than the CNAME itself, which is not allowed. args : - --aws-prefer-cname - --txt-prefix={{ YOUR_PREFIX }} The first two changes are needed if you use Route53 in Govcloud, which only supports private zones. There are also no cross account IAM whatsoever between Govcloud and commerical AWS accounts. If services and ingresses need to make Route 53 entries to an public zone in a commerical account, you will have set env variables of AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY with a key and secret to the commerical account that has the sufficient rights. env : - name : AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID value : XXXXXXXXX - name : AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY valueFrom : secretKeyRef : name : {{ YOUR_SECRET_NAME }} key : {{ YOUR_SECRET_KEY }} Clean up \u00b6 Make sure to delete all Service objects before terminating the cluster so all load balancers get cleaned up correctly. $ kubectl delete service nginx Give ExternalDNS some time to clean up the DNS records for you. Then delete the hosted zone if you created one for the testing purpose. $ aws route53 delete-hosted-zone --id /hostedzone/ZEWFWZ4R16P7IB Throttling \u00b6 Route53 has a 5 API requests per second per account hard quota . Running several fast polling ExternalDNS instances in a given account can easily hit that limit. Some ways to reduce the request rate include: * Reduce the polling loop\u2019s synchronization interval at the possible cost of slower change propagation (but see --events below to reduce the impact). * --interval=5m (default 1m ) * Trigger the polling loop on changes to K8s objects, rather than only at interval , to have responsive updates with long poll intervals * --events * Limit the sources watched when the --events flag is specified to specific types, namespaces, labels, or annotations * --source=ingress --source=service - specify multiple times for multiple sources * --namespace=my-app * --label-filter=app in (my-app) * --annotation-filter=kubernetes.io/ingress.class in (nginx-external) - note that this filter would apply to services too.. * Limit services watched by type (not applicable to ingress or other types) * --service-type-filter=LoadBalancer default all * Limit the hosted zones considered * --zone-id-filter=ABCDEF12345678 - specify multiple times if needed * --domain-filter=example.com by domain suffix - specify multiple times if needed * --regex-domain-filter=example* by domain suffix but as a regex - overrides domain-filter * --exclude-domains=ignore.this.example.com to exclude a domain or subdomain * --regex-domain-exclusion=ignore* subtracts it\u2019s matches from regex-domain-filter \u2018s matches * --aws-zone-type=public only sync zones of this type [public|private] * --aws-zone-tags=owner=k8s only sync zones with this tag * If the list of zones managed by ExternalDNS doesn\u2019t change frequently, cache it by setting a TTL. * --aws-zones-cache-duration=3h (default 0 - disabled) * Increase the number of changes applied to Route53 in each batch * --aws-batch-change-size=4000 (default 1000 ) * Increase the interval between changes * --aws-batch-change-interval=10s (default 1s ) * Introducing some jitter to the pod initialization, so that when multiple instances of ExternalDNS are updated at the same time they do not make their requests on the same second.

Therefore, please see the subsequent prerequisites. Prerequisites \u00b6 Azure Kubernetes Service is deployed and ready Azure CLI 2.0 and kubectl installed on the box to execute the subsequent steps Install NGINX Ingress Controller \u00b6 Helm is used to deploy the ingress controller. We employ the popular chart stable/nginx-ingress . $ helm install stable/nginx-ingress \\ --name nginx-ingress \\ --set controller.publishService.enabled=true The parameter controller.publishService.enabled needs to be set to true. It will make the ingress controller update the endpoint records of ingress-resources to contain the external-ip of the loadbalancer serving the ingress-controller. This is crucial as ExternalDNS reads those endpoints records when creating DNS-Records from ingress-resources. In the subsequent parameter we will make use of this. If you don\u2019t want to work with ingress-resources in your later use, you can leave the parameter out. Verify the correct propagation of the loadbalancer\u2019s ip by listing the ingresses. $ kubectl get ingress The address column should contain the ip for each ingress. ExternalDNS will pick up exactly this piece of information.

It will not automatically create zones. For this tutorial, we will create a Azure resource group named \u2018externaldns\u2019 that can easily be deleted later. $ az group create -n externaldns -l westeurope Substitute a more suitable location for the resource group if desired. As a prerequisite for Azure Private DNS to resolve records is to define links with VNETs. Thus, first create a VNET. $ az network vnet create \\ --name myvnet \\ --resource-group externaldns \\ --location westeurope \\ --address-prefix 10.2.0.0/16 \\ --subnet-name mysubnet \\ --subnet-prefixes 10.2.0.0/24 Next, create a Azure Private DNS zone for \u201cexample.com\u201d: $ az network private-dns zone create -g externaldns -n example.com Substitute a domain you own for \u201cexample.com\u201d if desired. Finally, create the mentioned link with the VNET. $ az network private-dns link vnet create -g externaldns -n mylink \\ -z example.com -v myvnet --registration-enabled false Configure service principal for managing the zone \u00b6 ExternalDNS needs permissions to make changes in Azure Private DNS. These permissions are roles assigned to the service principal used by ExternalDNS. A service principal with a minimum access level of Private DNS Zone Contributor to the Private DNS zone(s) and Reader to the resource group containing the Azure Private DNS zone(s) is necessary. More powerful role-assignments like Owner or assignments on subscription-level work too. Start off by creating the service principal without role-assignments. $ az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment -n http://externaldns-sp { \"appId\": \"appId GUID\", <-- aadClientId value ... \"password\": \"password\", <-- aadClientSecret value \"tenant\": \"AzureAD Tenant Id\" <-- tenantId value } Note: Alternatively, you can issue az account show --query \"tenantId\" to retrieve the id of your AAD Tenant too. Next, assign the roles to the service principal. But first retrieve the ID\u2019s of the objects to assign roles on. # find out the resource ids of the resource group where the dns zone is deployed, and the dns zone itself $ az group show --name externaldns --query id -o tsv /subscriptions/id/resourceGroups/externaldns $ az network private-dns zone show --name example.com -g externaldns --query id -o tsv /subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/externaldns/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/example.com Now, create role assignments . # 1. as a reader to the resource group $ az role assignment create --role \"Reader\" --assignee <appId GUID> --scope <resource group resource id> # 2. as a contributor to DNS Zone itself $ az role assignment create --role \"Private DNS Zone Contributor\" --assignee <appId GUID> --scope <dns zone resource id> Deploy ExternalDNS \u00b6 Configure kubectl to be able to communicate and authenticate with your cluster. This is per default done through the file ~/.kube/config . For general background information on this see kubernetes-docs . Azure-CLI features functionality for automatically maintaining this file for AKS-Clusters. See Azure-Docs . Follow the steps for azure-dns provider to create a configuration file.

Make sure to use >=0.11.0 version of ExternalDNS for this tutorial. This tutorial uses Azure CLI 2.0 for all Azure commands and assumes that the Kubernetes cluster was created via Azure Container Services and kubectl commands are being run on an orchestration node. Creating an Azure DNS zone \u00b6 The Azure provider for ExternalDNS will find suitable zones for domains it manages; it will not automatically create zones. For this tutorial, we will create a Azure resource group named MyDnsResourceGroup that can easily be deleted later: $ az group create --name \"MyDnsResourceGroup\" --location \"eastus\" Substitute a more suitable location for the resource group if desired. Next, create a Azure DNS zone for example.com : $ az network dns zone create --resource-group \"MyDnsResourceGroup\" --name \"example.com\" Substitute a domain you own for example.com if desired. If using your own domain that was registered with a third-party domain registrar, you should point your domain\u2019s name servers to the values in the nameServers field from the JSON data returned by the az network dns zone create command. Please consult your registrar\u2019s documentation on how to do that. Configuration file \u00b6 The azure provider will reference a configuration file called azure.json . The preferred way to inject the configuration file is by using a Kubernetes secret. The secret should contain an object named azure.json with content similar to this: { \"tenantId\" : \"01234abc-de56-ff78-abc1-234567890def\" , \"subscriptionId\" : \"01234abc-de56-ff78-abc1-234567890def\" , \"resourceGroup\" : \"MyDnsResourceGroup\" , \"aadClientId\" : \"01234abc-de56-ff78-abc1-234567890def\" , \"aadClientSecret\" : \"uKiuXeiwui4jo9quae9o\" } The following fields are used: tenantId ( required ) - run az account show --query \"tenantId\" or by selecting Azure Active Directory in the Azure Portal and checking the Directory ID under Properties. subscriptionId ( required ) - run az account show --query \"id\" or by selecting Subscriptions in the Azure Portal. resourceGroup ( required ) is the Resource Group created in a previous step that contains the Azure DNS Zone. aadClientID and aaClientSecret are associated with the Service Principal. This is only used with Service Principal method documented in the next section. useManagedIdentityExtension - this is set to true if you use either AKS Kubelet Identity or AAD Pod Identities methods documented in the next section. userAssignedIdentityID - this contains the client id from the Managed identitty when using the AAD Pod Identities method documented in the next setion. The Azure DNS provider expects, by default, that the configuration file is at /etc/kubernetes/azure.json . This can be overridden with the --azure-config-file option when starting ExternalDNS. Permissions to modify DNS zone \u00b6 ExternalDNS needs permissions to make changes to the Azure DNS zone. There are three ways configure the access needed: Service Principal Managed Identity Using AKS Kubelet Identity Managed Identity Using AAD Pod Identities Service Principal \u00b6 These permissions are defined in a Service Principal that should be made available to ExternalDNS as a configuration file azure.json . Creating a service principal \u00b6 A Service Principal with a minimum access level of DNS Zone Contributor or Contributor to the DNS zone(s) and Reader to the resource group containing the Azure DNS zone(s) is necessary for ExternalDNS to be able to edit DNS records. However, other more permissive access levels will work too (e.g. Contributor to the resource group or the whole subscription). This is an Azure CLI example on how to query the Azure API for the information required for the Resource Group and DNS zone you would have already created in previous steps (requires azure-cli and jq ) $ EXTERNALDNS_NEW_SP_NAME = \"ExternalDnsServicePrincipal\" # name of the service principal $ AZURE_DNS_ZONE_RESOURCE_GROUP = \"MyDnsResourceGroup\" # name of resource group where dns zone is hosted $ AZURE_DNS_ZONE = \"example.com\" # DNS zone name like example.com or sub.example.com # Create the service principal $ DNS_SP = $( az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $EXTERNALDNS_NEW_SP_NAME ) $ EXTERNALDNS_SP_APP_ID = $( echo $DNS_SP | jq -r '.appId' ) $ EXTERNALDNS_SP_PASSWORD = $( echo $DNS_SP | jq -r '.password' ) Assign the rights for the service principal \u00b6 Grant access to Azure DNS zone for the service principal. # fetch DNS id used to grant access to the service principal DNS_ID = $( az network dns zone show --name $AZURE_DNS_ZONE \\ --resource-group $AZURE_DNS_ZONE_RESOURCE_GROUP --query \"id\" --output tsv ) # 1. as a reader to the resource group $ az role assignment create --role \"Reader\" --assignee $EXTERNALDNS_SP_APP_ID --scope $DNS_ID # 2. as a contributor to DNS Zone itself $ az role assignment create --role \"Contributor\" --assignee $EXTERNALDNS_SP_APP_ID --scope $DNS_ID Creating a configuration file for the service principal \u00b6 Create the file azure.json with values gather from previous steps. cat <<-EOF > /local/path/to/azure.json { \"tenantId\": \"$(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)\", \"subscriptionId\": \"$(az account show --query id -o tsv)\", \"resourceGroup\": \"$AZURE_DNS_ZONE_RESOURCE_GROUP\", \"aadClientId\": \"$EXTERNALDNS_SP_APP_ID\", \"aadClientSecret\": \"$EXTERNALDNS_SP_PASSWORD\" } EOF Use this file to create a Kubernetes secret: $ kubectl create secret generic azure-config-file --namespace \"default\" --from-file /local/path/to/azure.json Managed identity using AKS Kubelet identity \u00b6 The managed identity that is assigned to the underlying node pool in the AKS cluster can be given permissions to access Azure DNS. Managed identities are essentially a service principal whose lifecycle is managed, such as deleting the AKS cluster will also delete the service principals associated with the AKS cluster. The managed identity assigned Kuberetes node pool, or specifically the VMSS , is called the Kubelet identity. The managed identites were previously called MSI (Managed Service Identity) and are enabled by default when creating an AKS cluster. Note that permissions granted to this identity will be accessible to all containers running inside the Kubernetes cluster, not just the ExternalDNS container(s). For the managed identity, the contents of azure.json should be similar to this: { \"tenantId\" : \"01234abc-de56-ff78-abc1-234567890def\" , \"subscriptionId\" : \"01234abc-de56-ff78-abc1-234567890def\" , \"resourceGroup\" : \"MyDnsResourceGroup\" , \"useManagedIdentityExtension\" : true } Fetching the Kubelet identity \u00b6 For this process, you will need to get the kublet identity: $ PRINCIPAL_ID = $( az aks show --resource-group $CLUSTER_GROUP --name $CLUSTERNAME \\ --query \"identityProfile.kubeletidentity.objectId\" --output tsv ) Assign rights for the Kubelet identity \u00b6 Grant access to Azure DNS zone for the kublet identity. $ AZURE_DNS_ZONE = \"example.com\" # DNS zone name like example.com or sub.example.com $ AZURE_DNS_ZONE_RESOURCE_GROUP = \"MyDnsResourceGroup\" # resource group where DNS zone is hosted # fetch DNS id used to grant access to the kublet identity $ DNS_ID = $( az network dns zone show --name $AZURE_DNS_ZONE \\ --resource-group $AZURE_DNS_ZONE_RESOURCE_GROUP --query \"id\" --output tsv ) $ az role assignment create --role \"DNS Zone Contributor\" --assignee $PRINCIPAL_ID --scope $DNS_ID Creating a configuration file for the kubelet identity \u00b6 Create the file azure.json with values gather from previous steps. cat <<-EOF > /local/path/to/azure.json { \"tenantId\": \"$(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)\", \"subscriptionId\": \"$(az account show --query id -o tsv)\", \"resourceGroup\": \"$AZURE_DNS_ZONE_RESOURCE_GROUP\", \"useManagedIdentityExtension\": true } EOF Use the azure.json file to create a Kubernetes secret: $ kubectl create secret generic azure-config-file --namespace \"default\" --from-file /local/path/to/azure.json Managed identity using AAD Pod Identities \u00b6 For this process, we will create a managed identity that will be explicitly used by the ExternalDNS container. This process is similar to Kubelet identity except that this managed identity is not associated with the Kubernetes node pool, but rather associated with explicit ExternalDNS containers. Enable the AAD Pod Identities feature \u00b6 For this solution, AAD Pod Identities preview feature can be enabled. The commands below should do the trick to enable this feature: $ az feature register --name EnablePodIdentityPreview --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService $ az feature register --name AutoUpgradePreview --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService $ az extension add --name aks-preview $ az extension update --name aks-preview $ az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService Deploy the AAD Pod Identities service \u00b6 Once enabled, you can update your cluster and install needed services for the AAD Pod Identities feature. $ AZURE_AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP = \"my-aks-cluster-group\" # name of resource group where aks cluster was created $ AZURE_AKS_CLUSTER_NAME = \"my-aks-cluster\" # name of aks cluster previously created $ az aks update --resource-group ${ AZURE_AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP } --name ${ AZURE_AKS_CLUSTER_NAME } --enable-pod-identity Note that, if you use the default network plugin kubenet , then you need to add the command line option --enable-pod-identity-with-kubenet to the above command. Creating the managed identity \u00b6 After this process is finished, create a managed identity. $ IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP = $AZURE_AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP # custom group or reuse AKS group $ IDENTITY_NAME = \"example-com-identity\" # create a managed identity $ az identity create --resource-group \" ${ IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP } \" --name \" ${ IDENTITY_NAME } \" Assign rights for the managed identity \u00b6 Grant access to Azure DNS zone for the managed identity. $ AZURE_DNS_ZONE_RESOURCE_GROUP = \"MyDnsResourceGroup\" # name of resource group where dns zone is hosted $ AZURE_DNS_ZONE = \"example.com\" # DNS zone name like example.com or sub.example.com # fetch identity client id from managed identity created earlier $ IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID = $( az identity show --resource-group \" ${ IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP } \" \\ --name \" ${ IDENTITY_NAME } \" --query \"clientId\" --output tsv ) # fetch DNS id used to grant access to the managed identity $ DNS_ID = $( az network dns zone show --name \" ${ AZURE_DNS_ZONE } \" \\ --resource-group \" ${ AZURE_DNS_ZONE_RESOURCE_GROUP } \" --query \"id\" --output tsv ) $ az role assignment create --role \"DNS Zone Contributor\" \\ --assignee \" ${ IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID } \" --scope \" ${ DNS_ID } \" Creating a configuration file for the managed identity \u00b6 Create the file azure.json with the values from previous steps: cat <<-EOF > /local/path/to/azure.json { \"tenantId\": \"$(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)\", \"subscriptionId\": \"$(az account show --query id -o tsv)\", \"resourceGroup\": \"$AZURE_DNS_ZONE_RESOURCE_GROUP\", \"useManagedIdentityExtension\": true, \"userAssignedIdentityID\": \"$IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID\" } EOF Use the azure.json file to create a Kubernetes secret: $ kubectl create secret generic azure-config-file --namespace \"default\" --from-file /local/path/to/azure.json Creating an Azure identity binding \u00b6 A binding between the managed identity and the ExternalDNS pods needs to be setup by creating AzureIdentity and AzureIdentityBinding resources. This will allow appropriately labeled ExternalDNS pods to authenticate using the managed identity. When AAD Pod Identity feature is enabled from previous steps above, the az aks pod-identity add can be used to create these resources: $ IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID = $( az identity show --resource-group ${ IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP } \\ --name ${ IDENTITY_NAME } --query id --output tsv ) $ az aks pod-identity add --resource-group ${ AZURE_AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP } \\ --cluster-name ${ AZURE_AKS_CLUSTER_NAME } --namespace \"default\" \\ --name \"external-dns\" --identity-resource-id ${ IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID } This will add something similar to the following resouces: apiVersion : aadpodidentity.k8s.io/v1 kind : AzureIdentity metadata : labels : addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode : Reconcile kubernetes.azure.com/managedby : aks name : external-dns spec : clientID : $IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID resourceID : $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID type : 0 --- apiVersion : aadpodidentity.k8s.io/v1 kind : AzureIdentityBinding metadata : annotations : labels : addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode : Reconcile kubernetes.azure.com/managedby : aks name : external-dns-binding spec : azureIdentity : external-dns selector : external-dns Update ExternalDNS labels \u00b6 When deploying ExternalDNS, you want to make sure that deployed pod(s) will have the label aadpodidbinding: external-dns to enable AAD Pod Identities. You can patch an existing deployment of ExternalDNS with this command: kubectl patch deployment external-dns --namespace \"default\" --patch \\ '{\"spec\": {\"template\": {\"metadata\": {\"labels\": {\"aadpodidbinding\": \"external-dns\"}}}}}' Ingress used with ExternalDNS \u00b6 This deployment assumes that you will be using nginx-ingress. When using nginx-ingress do not deploy it as a Daemon Set. This causes nginx-ingress to write the Cluster IP of the backend pods in the ingress status.loadbalancer.ip property which then has external-dns write the Cluster IP(s) in DNS vs. the nginx-ingress service external IP.

Creating a Cloudflare DNS zone \u00b6 We highly recommend to read this tutorial if you haven\u2019t used Cloudflare before: Create a Cloudflare account and add a website Creating Cloudflare Credentials \u00b6 Snippet from Cloudflare - Getting Started : Cloudflare\u2019s API exposes the entire Cloudflare infrastructure via a standardized programmatic interface. Using Cloudflare\u2019s API, you can do just about anything you can do on cloudflare.com via the customer dashboard. The Cloudflare API is a RESTful API based on HTTPS requests and JSON responses. If you are registered with Cloudflare, you can obtain your API key from the bottom of the \u201cMy Account\u201d page, found here: Go to My account . API Token will be preferred for authentication if CF_API_TOKEN environment variable is set. Otherwise CF_API_KEY and CF_API_EMAIL should be set to run ExternalDNS with Cloudflare. When using API Token authentication, the token should be granted Zone Read , DNS Edit privileges, and access to All zones . If you would like to further restrict the API permissions to a specific zone (or zones), you also need to use the --zone-id-filter so that the underlying API requests only access the zones that you explicitly specify, as opposed to accessing all zones. Deploy ExternalDNS \u00b6 Connect your kubectl client to the cluster you want to test ExternalDNS with. Then apply one of the following manifests file to deploy ExternalDNS.

The annotation may also be a subdomain of the DNS zone (e.g. \u2018www.example.com\u2019). By setting the TTL annotation on the service, you have to pass a valid TTL, which must be 120 or above. This annotation is optional, if you won\u2019t set it, it will be 1 (automatic) which is 300. For Cloudflare proxied entries, set the TTL annotation to 1 (automatic), or do not set it. ExternalDNS uses this annotation to determine what services should be registered with DNS. Removing the annotation will cause ExternalDNS to remove the corresponding DNS records. Create the deployment and service: $ kubectl create -f nginx.yaml Depending where you run your service it can take a little while for your cloud provider to create an external IP for the service. Once the service has an external IP assigned, ExternalDNS will notice the new service IP address and synchronize the Cloudflare DNS records. Verifying Cloudflare DNS records \u00b6 Check your Cloudflare dashboard to view the records for your Cloudflare DNS zone. Substitute the zone for the one created above if a different domain was used. This should show the external IP address of the service as the A record for your domain. Cleanup \u00b6 Now that we have verified that ExternalDNS will automatically manage Cloudflare DNS records, we can delete the tutorial\u2019s example: $ kubectl delete -f nginx.yaml $ kubectl delete -f externaldns.yaml Setting cloudflare-proxied on a per-ingress basis \u00b6 Using the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/cloudflare-proxied: \"true\" annotation on your ingress, you can specify if the proxy feature of Cloudflare should be enabled for that record.

Authenticating with OpenStack \u00b6 We are going to use OpenStack CLI - openstack utility, which is an umbrella application for most of OpenStack clients including designate . All OpenStack CLIs require authentication parameters to be provided. These parameters include: * URL of the OpenStack identity service ( keystone ) which is responsible for user authentication and also served as a registry for other OpenStack services. Designate endpoints must be registered in keystone in order to ExternalDNS and OpenStack CLI be able to find them. * OpenStack region name * User login name. * User project (tenant) name. * User domain (only when using keystone API v3) Although these parameters can be passed explicitly through the CLI flags, traditionally it is done by sourcing openrc file ( source ~/openrc ) that is a shell snippet that sets environment variables that all OpenStack CLI understand by convention. Recent versions of OpenStack Dashboard have a nice UI to download openrc file for both v2 and v3 auth protocols. Both protocols can be used with ExternalDNS. v3 is generally preferred over v2, but might not be available in some OpenStack installations. Installing OpenStack Designate \u00b6 Please refer to the Designate deployment tutorial for instructions on how to install and test Designate with BIND backend. You will be required to have admin rights in existing OpenStack installation to do this. One convenient way to get yourself an OpenStack installation to play with is to use DevStack . Creating DNS zones \u00b6 All domain names that are ExternalDNS is going to create must belong to one of DNS zones created in advance. Here is an example of how to create example.com DNS zone: $ openstack zone create --email dnsmaster@example.com example.com. It is important to manually create all the zones that are going to be used for kubernetes entities (ExternalDNS sources) before starting ExternalDNS. Deploy ExternalDNS \u00b6 Create a deployment file called externaldns.yaml with the following contents: Manifest (for clusters without RBAC enabled) \u00b6 apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : external-dns spec : strategy : type : Recreate selector : matchLabels : app : external-dns template : metadata : labels : app : external-dns spec : containers : - name : external-dns image : k8s.gcr.io/external-dns/external-dns:v0.7.6 args : - --source=service # ingress is also possible - --domain-filter=example.com # (optional) limit to only example.com domains; change to match the zone created above. - --provider=designate env : # values from openrc file - name : OS_AUTH_URL value : https://controller/identity/v3 - name : OS_REGION_NAME value : RegionOne - name : OS_USERNAME value : admin - name : OS_PASSWORD value : p@ssw0rd - name : OS_PROJECT_NAME value : demo - name : OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME value : Default Manifest (for clusters with RBAC enabled) \u00b6 apiVersion : v1 kind : ServiceAccount metadata : name : external-dns --- apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind : ClusterRole metadata : name : external-dns rules : - apiGroups : [ \"\" ] resources : [ \"services\" , \"endpoints\" , \"pods\" ] verbs : [ \"get\" , \"watch\" , \"list\" ] - apiGroups : [ \"\" ] resources : [ \"pods\" ] verbs : [ \"get\" , \"watch\" , \"list\" ] - apiGroups : [ \"extensions\" , \"networking.k8s.io\" ] resources : [ \"ingresses\" ] verbs : [ \"get\" , \"watch\" , \"list\" ] - apiGroups : [ \"\" ] resources : [ \"nodes\" ] verbs : [ \"watch\" , \"list\" ] --- apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind : ClusterRoleBinding metadata : name : external-dns-viewer roleRef : apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind : ClusterRole name : external-dns subjects : - kind : ServiceAccount name : external-dns namespace : default --- apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : external-dns spec : selector : matchLabels : app : external-dns strategy : type : Recreate template : metadata : labels : app : external-dns spec : serviceAccountName : external-dns containers : - name : external-dns image : k8s.gcr.io/external-dns/external-dns:v0.7.6 args : - --source=service # ingress is also possible - --domain-filter=example.com # (optional) limit to only example.com domains; change to match the zone created above. - --provider=designate env : # values from openrc file - name : OS_AUTH_URL value : https://controller/identity/v3 - name : OS_REGION_NAME value : RegionOne - name : OS_USERNAME value : admin - name : OS_PASSWORD value : p@ssw0rd - name : OS_PROJECT_NAME value : demo - name : OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME value : Default Create the deployment for ExternalDNS: $ kubectl create -f externaldns.yaml Optional: Trust self-sign certificates \u00b6 If your OpenStack-Installation is configured with a self-sign certificate, you could extend the pod.spec with following secret-mount: volumeMounts : - mountPath : /etc/ssl/certs/ name : cacerts volumes : - name : cacerts secret : defaultMode : 420 secretName : self-sign-certs content of the secret self-sign-certs must be the certificate/chain in PEM format. Deploying an Nginx Service \u00b6 Create a service file called \u2018nginx.yaml\u2019 with the following contents: apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : nginx spec : selector : matchLabels : app : nginx template : metadata : labels : app : nginx spec : containers : - image : nginx name : nginx ports : - containerPort : 80 --- apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : name : nginx annotations : external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname : my-app.example.com spec : selector : app : nginx type : LoadBalancer ports : - protocol : TCP port : 80 targetPort : 80 Note the annotation on the service; use the same hostname as the DNS zone created above. ExternalDNS uses this annotation to determine what services should be registered with DNS. Removing the annotation will cause ExternalDNS to remove the corresponding DNS records. Create the deployment and service: $ kubectl create -f nginx.yaml Once the service has an external IP assigned, ExternalDNS will notice the new service IP address and notify Designate, which in turn synchronize DNS records with underlying DNS server backend. Verifying DNS records \u00b6 To verify that DNS record was indeed created, you can use the following command: $ openstack recordset list example.com. There should be a record for my-app.example.com having ACTIVE status. And of course, the ultimate method to verify is to issue a DNS query: $ dig my-app.example.com @controller Cleanup \u00b6 Now that we have verified that ExternalDNS created all DNS records, we can delete the tutorial\u2019s example: $ kubectl delete service -f nginx.yaml $ kubectl delete service -f externaldns.yaml","title":"Setting up ExternalDNS for Services on OpenStack Designate"},{"location":"tutorials/designate/#setting-up-externaldns-for-services-on-openstack-designate","text":"This tutorial describes how to setup ExternalDNS for usage within a Kubernetes cluster using OpenStack Designate DNS.","title":"Setting up ExternalDNS for Services on OpenStack Designate"},{"location":"tutorials/designate/#authenticating-with-openstack","text":"We are going to use OpenStack CLI - openstack utility, which is an umbrella application for most of OpenStack clients including designate .

Setup \u00b6 We will go through a small example of deploying a simple Kafka with use of a headless service. External DNS \u00b6 A simple deploy could look like this: Manifest (for clusters without RBAC enabled) \u00b6 apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : external-dns spec : strategy : type : Recreate selector : matchLabels : app : external-dns template : metadata : labels : app : external-dns spec : containers : - name : external-dns image : k8s.gcr.io/external-dns/external-dns:v0.7.6 args : - --log-level=debug - --source=service - --source=ingress - --namespace=dev - --domain-filter=example.org. - --provider=aws - --registry=txt - --txt-owner-id=dev.example.org Manifest (for clusters with RBAC enabled) \u00b6 apiVersion : v1 kind : ServiceAccount metadata : name : external-dns --- apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind : ClusterRole metadata : name : external-dns rules : - apiGroups : [ \"\" ] resources : [ \"services\" , \"endpoints\" , \"pods\" ] verbs : [ \"get\" , \"watch\" , \"list\" ] - apiGroups : [ \"extensions\" , \"networking.k8s.io\" ] resources : [ \"ingresses\" ] verbs : [ \"get\" , \"watch\" , \"list\" ] - apiGroups : [ \"\" ] resources : [ \"nodes\" ] verbs : [ \"list\" ] --- apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind : ClusterRoleBinding metadata : name : external-dns-viewer roleRef : apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind : ClusterRole name : external-dns subjects : - kind : ServiceAccount name : external-dns namespace : default --- apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : external-dns spec : strategy : type : Recreate selector : matchLabels : app : external-dns template : metadata : labels : app : external-dns spec : serviceAccountName : external-dns containers : - name : external-dns image : k8s.gcr.io/external-dns/external-dns:v0.7.6 args : - --log-level=debug - --source=service - --source=ingress - --namespace=dev - --domain-filter=example.org. - --provider=aws - --registry=txt - --txt-owner-id=dev.example.org Kafka Stateful Set \u00b6 First lets deploy a Kafka Stateful set, a simple example(a lot of stuff is missing) with a headless service called ksvc apiVersion : apps/v1beta1 kind : StatefulSet metadata : name : kafka spec : serviceName : ksvc replicas : 3 template : metadata : labels : component : kafka spec : containers : - name : kafka image : confluent/kafka ports : - containerPort : 9092 hostPort : 9092 name : external command : - bash - -c - \" export DOMAIN=$(hostname -d) && \\ export KAFKA_BROKER_ID=$(echo $HOSTNAME|rev|cut -d '-' -f 1|rev) && \\ export KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=$ZK_CSVC_SERVICE_HOST:$ZK_CSVC_SERVICE_PORT && \\ export KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://$HOSTNAME.example.org:9092 && \\ /etc/confluent/docker/run\" volumeMounts : - name : datadir mountPath : /var/lib/kafka volumeClaimTemplates : - metadata : name : datadir annotations : volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class : st1 spec : accessModes : [ \"ReadWriteOnce\" ] resources : requests : storage : 500Gi Very important here, is to set the hostPort (only works if the PodSecurityPolicy allows it)! and in case your app requires an actual hostname inside the container, unlike Kafka, which can advertise on another address, you have to set the hostname yourself. Headless Service \u00b6 Now we need to define a headless service to use to expose the Kafka pods. There are generally two approaches to use expose the nodeport of a Headless service: Add --fqdn-template={{name}}.example.org Use a full annotation If you go with #1, you just need to define the headless service, here is an example of the case #2: apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : name : ksvc annotations : external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname : example.org spec : ports : - port : 9092 name : external clusterIP : None selector : component : kafka This will create 3 dns records: kafka-0.example.org kafka-1.example.org kafka-2.example.org If you set --fqdn-template={{name}}.example.org you can omit the annotation. Generally it is a better approach to use --fqdn-template={{name}}.example.org , because then you would get the service name inside the generated A records: kafka-0.ksvc.example.org kafka-1.ksvc.example.org kafka-2.ksvc.example.org Using pods\u2019 HostIPs as targets \u00b6 Add the following annotation to your Service : external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/endpoints-type : HostIP external-dns will now publish the value of the .status.hostIP field of the pods backing your Service . #### Using node external IPs as targets Add the following annotation to your `Service`: ```yaml external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/endpoints-type: NodeExternalIP external-dns will now publish the node external IP ( .status.addresses entries of with type: NodeExternalIP ) of the nodes on which the pods backing your Service are running. Using pod annotations to specify target IPs \u00b6 Add the following annotation to the pods backing your Service : external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target : \"1.2.3.4\" external-dns will publish the IP specified in the annotation of each pod instead of using the podIP advertised by Kubernetes. This can be useful e.g. if you are NATing public IPs onto your pod IPs and want to publish these in DNS.","title":"Setting up ExternalDNS for Headless Services"},{"location":"tutorials/hostport/#setting-up-externaldns-for-headless-services","text":"This tutorial describes how to setup ExternalDNS for usage in conjunction with a Headless service.","title":"Setting up ExternalDNS for Headless Services"},{"location":"tutorials/hostport/#use-cases","text":"The main use cases that inspired this feature is the necessity for fixed addressable hostnames with services, such as Kafka when trying to access them from outside the cluster.

The annotation may also be a subdomain of the DNS zone (e.g. \u2018www.example.com\u2019). By setting the TTL annotation on the service, you have to pass a valid TTL, which must be 120 or above. This annotation is optional, if you won\u2019t set it, it will be 1 (automatic) which is 300. ExternalDNS uses this annotation to determine what services should be registered with DNS. Removing the annotation will cause ExternalDNS to remove the corresponding DNS records. Create the deployment and service: $ kubectl create -f nginx.yaml Depending where you run your service it can take a little while for your cloud provider to create an external IP for the service. Once the service has an external IP assigned, ExternalDNS will notice the new service IP address and synchronize the IBMCloud DNS records. Verifying IBMCloud DNS records \u00b6 Run the following command to view the A records: Public Zone \u00b6 # Get the domain ID with below command on IBMCloud Internet Services instance `external-dns-public` $ ibmcloud cis domains -i external-dns-public # Get the records with domain ID $ ibmcloud cis dns-records DOMAIN_ID -i external-dns-public Private Zone \u00b6 # Get the domain ID with below command on IBMCloud DNS Services instance `external-dns-private` $ ibmcloud dns zones -i external-dns-private # Get the records with domain ID $ ibmcloud dns resource-records ZONE_ID -i external-dns-public This should show the external IP address of the service as the A record for your domain. Cleanup \u00b6 Now that we have verified that ExternalDNS will automatically manage IBMCloud DNS records, we can delete the tutorial\u2019s example: $ kubectl delete -f nginx.yaml $ kubectl delete -f externaldns.yaml Setting proxied records on public zone \u00b6 Using the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ibmcloud-proxied: \"true\" annotation on your ingress or service, you can specify if the proxy feature of IBMCloud public DNS should be enabled for that record. This setting will override the global --ibmcloud-proxied setting. Active priviate zone with VPC allocated \u00b6 By default, IBMCloud DNS Services don\u2019t active your private zone with new zone added, with externale DNS, you can use external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ibmcloud-vpc: \"crn:v1:bluemix:public:is:us-south:a/bcf1865e99742d38d2d5fc3fb80a5496::vpc:r006-74353823-a60d-42e4-97c5-5e2551278435\" annotation on your ingress or service, it will active your private zone with in specific VPC for that record created in. this setting won\u2019t work if the private zone was active already.

The annotation may also be a subdomain of the DNS zone (e.g. \u2018www.example.com\u2019). ExternalDNS uses this annotation to determine what services should be registered with DNS. Removing the annotation will cause ExternalDNS to remove the corresponding DNS records. Create the deployment and service: $ kubectl create -f nginx.yaml It takes a little while for the Infoblox cloud provider to create an external IP for the service. Check the status by running kubectl get services nginx . If the EXTERNAL-IP field shows an address, the service is ready to be accessed externally. Once the service has an external IP assigned, ExternalDNS will notice the new service IP address and synchronize the Infoblox DNS records. Verifying Infoblox DNS records \u00b6 Run the following command to view the A records for your Infoblox DNS zone: $ curl -kl \\ -X GET \\ -u ${WAPI_USERNAME}:${WAPI_PASSWORD} \\ https://${GRID_HOST}:${WAPI_PORT}/wapi/v${WAPI_VERSION}/record:a?zone=example.com Substitute the zone for the one created above if a different domain was used. This should show the external IP address of the service as the A record for your domain (\u2018@\u2019 indicates the record is for the zone itself). Clean up \u00b6 Now that we have verified that ExternalDNS will automatically manage Infoblox DNS records, we can delete the tutorial\u2019s DNS zone: $ curl -kl \\ -X DELETE \\ -u ${WAPI_USERNAME}:${WAPI_PASSWORD} \\ https://${GRID_HOST}:${WAPI_PORT}/wapi/v${WAPI_VERSION}/zone_auth?fqdn=example.com Ability to filter results from the zone auth API using a regular expression \u00b6 There is also the ability to filter results from the Infoblox zone_auth service based upon a regular expression. See the Infoblox API document for examples. To use this feature for the zone_auth service, set the parameter infoblox-fqdn-regex for external-dns to a regular expression that makes sense for you. For instance, to only return hosted zones that start with staging in the test.com domain (like staging.beta.test.com, or staging.test.com), use the following command line option when starting external-dns --infoblox-fqdn-regex=^staging.*test.com$ Infoblox PTR record support \u00b6 There is an option to enable PTR records support for infoblox provider. PTR records allow to do reverse dns search. To enable PTR records support, add following into arguments for external-dns: --infoblox-create-ptr to allow management of PTR records. You can also add a filter for reverse dns zone to limit PTR records to specific zones only: --domain-filter=10.196.0.0/16 change this to the reverse zone(s) as defined in your infoblox.

Setting up ExternalDNS and kube-ingress-aws-controller \u00b6 Follow the AWS tutorial to setup ExternalDNS for use in Kubernetes clusters running in AWS. Specify the source=ingress argument so that ExternalDNS will look for hostnames in Ingress objects. In addition, you may wish to limit which Ingress objects are used as an ExternalDNS source via the ingress-class argument, but this is not required. For help setting up the Kubernetes Ingress AWS Controller, that can create ALBs and NLBs, follow the Setup Guide . Optional RouteGroup \u00b6 RouteGroup is a CRD, that enables you to do complex routing with Skipper . First, you have to apply the RouteGroup CRD to your cluster: kubectl apply -f https://github.com/zalando/skipper/blob/HEAD/dataclients/kubernetes/deploy/apply/routegroups_crd.yaml You have to grant all controllers: Skipper , kube-ingress-aws-controller and external-dns to read the routegroup resource and kube-ingress-aws-controller to update the status field of a routegroup. This depends on your RBAC policies, in case you use RBAC, you can use this for all 3 controllers: apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind : ClusterRole metadata : name : kube-ingress-aws-controller rules : - apiGroups : - extensions - networking.k8s.io resources : - ingresses verbs : - get - list - watch - apiGroups : - extensions - networking.k8s.io resources : - ingresses/status verbs : - patch - update - apiGroups : - zalando.org resources : - routegroups verbs : - get - list - watch - apiGroups : - zalando.org resources : - routegroups/status verbs : - patch - update See also current RBAC yaml files: - kube-ingress-aws-controller - skipper - external-dns Deploy an example application \u00b6 Create the following sample \u201cechoserver\u201d application to demonstrate how ExternalDNS works with ingress objects, that were created by kube-ingress-aws-controller . apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : echoserver spec : replicas : 1 selector : matchLabels : app : echoserver template : metadata : labels : app : echoserver spec : containers : - image : gcr.io/google_containers/echoserver:1.4 imagePullPolicy : Always name : echoserver ports : - containerPort : 8080 --- apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : name : echoserver spec : ports : - port : 80 targetPort : 8080 protocol : TCP type : ClusterIP selector : app : echoserver Note that the Service object is of type ClusterIP , because we will target Skipper and do the HTTP routing in Skipper. We don\u2019t need a Service of type LoadBalancer here, since we will be using a shared skipper-ingress for all Ingress. Skipper use hostNetwork to be able to get traffic from AWS LoadBalancers EC2 network. ALBs or NLBs, will be created based on need and will be shared across all ingress as default. Ingress examples \u00b6 Create the following Ingress to expose the echoserver application to the Internet. apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1 kind : Ingress metadata : annotations : kubernetes.io/ingress.class : skipper name : echoserver spec : ingressClassName : skipper rules : - host : echoserver.mycluster.example.org http : &echoserver_root paths : - path : / backend : service : name : echoserver port : number : 80 pathType : Prefix - host : echoserver.example.org http : *echoserver_root The above should result in the creation of an (ipv4) ALB in AWS which will forward traffic to skipper which will forward to the echoserver application. If the --source=ingress argument is specified, then ExternalDNS will create DNS records based on the hosts specified in ingress objects. The above example would result in two alias records being created, echoserver.mycluster.example.org and echoserver.example.org , which both alias the ALB that is associated with the Ingress object. Note that the above example makes use of the YAML anchor feature to avoid having to repeat the http section for multiple hosts that use the exact same paths. If this Ingress object will only be fronting one backend Service, we might instead create the following: apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1 kind : Ingress metadata : annotations : external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname : echoserver.mycluster.example.org, echoserver.example.org kubernetes.io/ingress.class : skipper name : echoserver spec : ingressClassName : skipper rules : - http : paths : - path : / backend : service : name : echoserver port : number : 80 pathType : Prefix In the above example we create a default path that works for any hostname, and make use of the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname annotation to create multiple aliases for the resulting ALB. Dualstack ALBs \u00b6 AWS supports both IPv4 and \u201cdualstack\u201d (both IPv4 and IPv6) interfaces for ALBs. The Kubernetes Ingress AWS controller supports the alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ip-address-type annotation (which defaults to ipv4 ) to determine this. If this annotation is set to dualstack then ExternalDNS will create two alias records (one A record and one AAAA record) for each hostname associated with the Ingress object. Example: apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1 kind : Ingress metadata : annotations : alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ip-address-type : dualstack kubernetes.io/ingress.class : skipper name : echoserver spec : ingressClassName : skipper rules : - host : echoserver.example.org http : paths : - path : / backend : service : name : echoserver port : number : 80 pathType : Prefix The above Ingress object will result in the creation of an ALB with a dualstack interface. ExternalDNS will create both an A echoserver.example.org record and an AAAA record of the same name, that each are aliases for the same ALB. NLBs \u00b6 AWS has NLBs and kube-ingress-aws-controller is able to create NLBs instead of ALBs. The Kubernetes Ingress AWS controller supports the zalando.org/aws-load-balancer-type annotation (which defaults to alb ) to determine this. If this annotation is set to nlb then ExternalDNS will create an NLB instead of an ALB. Example: apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1 kind : Ingress metadata : annotations : zalando.org/aws-load-balancer-type : nlb kubernetes.io/ingress.class : skipper name : echoserver spec : ingressClassName : skipper rules : - host : echoserver.example.org http : paths : - path : / backend : service : name : echoserver port : number : 80 pathType : Prefix The above Ingress object will result in the creation of an NLB. A successful create, you can observe in the ingress status field, that is written by kube-ingress-aws-controller : status : loadBalancer : ingress : - hostname : kube-ing-lb-atedkrlml7iu-1681027139.$region.elb.amazonaws.com ExternalDNS will create a A-records echoserver.example.org , that use AWS ALIAS record to automatically maintain IP addresses of the NLB. RouteGroup (optional) \u00b6 Kube-ingress-aws-controller , Skipper and external-dns support RouteGroups . External-dns needs to be started with --source=skipper-routegroup parameter in order to work on RouteGroup objects. Here we can not show all RouteGroup capabilities , but we show one simple example with an application and a custom https redirect. apiVersion : zalando.org/v1 kind : RouteGroup metadata : name : my-route-group spec : backends : - name : my-backend type : service serviceName : my-service servicePort : 80 - name : redirectShunt type : shunt defaultBackends : - backendName : my-service routes : - pathSubtree : / - pathSubtree : / predicates : - Header(\"X-Forwarded-Proto\", \"http\") filters : - redirectTo(302, \"https:\") backends : - redirectShunt","title":"Using ExternalDNS with kube-ingress-aws-controller"},{"location":"tutorials/kube-ingress-aws/#using-externaldns-with-kube-ingress-aws-controller","text":"This tutorial describes how to use ExternalDNS with the kube-ingress-aws-controller .","title":"Using ExternalDNS with kube-ingress-aws-controller"},{"location":"tutorials/kube-ingress-aws/#setting-up-externaldns-and-kube-ingress-aws-controller","text":"Follow the AWS tutorial to setup ExternalDNS for use in Kubernetes clusters running in AWS.

In this case it\u2019s ns-cloud-{e1-e4}.googledomains.com. but your\u2019s could slightly differ, e.g. {a1-a4} , {b1-b4} etc. Tell the parent zone where to find the DNS records for this zone by adding the corresponding NS records there. Assuming the parent zone is \u201cgcp-zalan-do\u201d and the domain is \u201cgcp.zalan.do\u201d and that it\u2019s also hosted at Google we would do the following. $ gcloud dns record-sets transaction start --zone \"gcp-zalan-do\" $ gcloud dns record-sets transaction add ns-cloud-e { 1 ..4 } .googledomains.com. \\ --name \"external-dns-test.gcp.zalan.do.\" --ttl 300 --type NS --zone \"gcp-zalan-do\" $ gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute --zone \"gcp-zalan-do\" Connect your kubectl client to the cluster you just created and bind your GCP user to the cluster admin role in Kubernetes. $ gcloud container clusters get-credentials \"external-dns\" $ kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-me \\ --clusterrole = cluster-admin --user = \" $( gcloud config get-value account ) \" Deploy the nginx ingress controller \u00b6 First, you need to deploy the nginx-based ingress controller. It can be deployed in at least two modes: Leveraging a Layer 4 load balancer in front of the nginx proxies or directly targeting pods with hostPorts on your worker nodes. ExternalDNS doesn\u2019t really care and supports both modes. Default Backend \u00b6 The nginx controller uses a default backend that it serves when no Ingress rule matches. This is a separate Service that can be picked by you. We\u2019ll use the default backend that\u2019s used by other ingress controllers for that matter. Apply the following manifests to your cluster to deploy the default backend. apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : name : default-http-backend spec : ports : - port : 80 targetPort : 8080 selector : app : default-http-backend --- apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : default-http-backend spec : selector : matchLabels : app : default-http-backend template : metadata : labels : app : default-http-backend spec : containers : - name : default-http-backend image : gcr.io/google_containers/defaultbackend:1.3 Without a separate TCP load balancer \u00b6 By default, the controller will update your Ingress objects with the public IPs of the nodes running your nginx controller instances. You should run multiple instances in case of pod or node failure. The controller will do leader election and will put multiple IPs as targets in your Ingress objects in that case. It could also make sense to run it as a DaemonSet. However, we\u2019ll just run a single replica. You have to open the respective ports on all of your worker nodes to allow nginx to receive traffic. $ gcloud compute firewall-rules create \"allow-http\" --allow tcp:80 --source-ranges \"0.0.0.0/0\" --target-tags \"gke-external-dns-9488ba14-node\" $ gcloud compute firewall-rules create \"allow-https\" --allow tcp:443 --source-ranges \"0.0.0.0/0\" --target-tags \"gke-external-dns-9488ba14-node\" Change --target-tags to the corresponding tags of your nodes. You can find them by describing your instances or by looking at the default firewall rules created by GKE for your cluster. Apply the following manifests to your cluster to deploy the nginx-based ingress controller. Note, how it receives a reference to the default backend\u2019s Service and that it listens on hostPorts. (You may have to use hostNetwork: true as well.) apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : nginx-ingress-controller spec : selector : matchLabels : app : nginx-ingress-controller template : metadata : labels : app : nginx-ingress-controller spec : containers : - name : nginx-ingress-controller image : gcr.io/google_containers/nginx-ingress-controller:0.9.0-beta.3 args : - /nginx-ingress-controller - --default-backend-service=default/default-http-backend env : - name : POD_NAME valueFrom : fieldRef : fieldPath : metadata.name - name : POD_NAMESPACE valueFrom : fieldRef : fieldPath : metadata.namespace ports : - containerPort : 80 hostPort : 80 - containerPort : 443 hostPort : 443 With a separate TCP load balancer \u00b6 However, you can also have the ingress controller proxied by a Kubernetes Service. This will instruct the controller to populate this Service\u2019s external IP as the external IP of the Ingress. This exposes the nginx proxies via a Layer 4 load balancer ( type=LoadBalancer ) which is more reliable than the other method. With that approach, you can run as many nginx proxy instances on your cluster as you like or have them autoscaled. This is the preferred way of running the nginx controller. Apply the following manifests to your cluster. Note, how the controller is receiving an additional flag telling it which Service it should treat as its public endpoint and how it doesn\u2019t need hostPorts anymore. Apply the following manifests to run the controller in this mode. apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : name : nginx-ingress-controller spec : type : LoadBalancer ports : - name : http port : 80 targetPort : 80 - name : https port : 443 targetPort : 443 selector : app : nginx-ingress-controller --- apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : nginx-ingress-controller spec : selector : matchLabels : app : nginx-ingress-controller template : metadata : labels : app : nginx-ingress-controller spec : containers : - name : nginx-ingress-controller image : gcr.io/google_containers/nginx-ingress-controller:0.9.0-beta.3 args : - /nginx-ingress-controller - --default-backend-service=default/default-http-backend - --publish-service=default/nginx-ingress-controller env : - name : POD_NAME valueFrom : fieldRef : fieldPath : metadata.name - name : POD_NAMESPACE valueFrom : fieldRef : fieldPath : metadata.namespace ports : - containerPort : 80 - containerPort : 443 Deploy ExternalDNS \u00b6 Apply the following manifest file to deploy ExternalDNS. apiVersion : v1 kind : ServiceAccount metadata : name : external-dns --- apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind : ClusterRole metadata : name : external-dns rules : - apiGroups : [ \"\" ] resources : [ \"services\" , \"endpoints\" , \"pods\" ] verbs : [ \"get\" , \"watch\" , \"list\" ] - apiGroups : [ \"extensions\" , \"networking.k8s.io\" ] resources : [ \"ingresses\" ] verbs : [ \"get\" , \"watch\" , \"list\" ] - apiGroups : [ \"\" ] resources : [ \"nodes\" ] verbs : [ \"list\" ] --- apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind : ClusterRoleBinding metadata : name : external-dns-viewer roleRef : apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind : ClusterRole name : external-dns subjects : - kind : ServiceAccount name : external-dns namespace : default --- apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : external-dns spec : strategy : type : Recreate selector : matchLabels : app : external-dns template : metadata : labels : app : external-dns spec : serviceAccountName : external-dns containers : - name : external-dns image : k8s.gcr.io/external-dns/external-dns:v0.7.6 args : - --source=ingress - --domain-filter=external-dns-test.gcp.zalan.do - --provider=google - --google-project=zalando-external-dns-test - --registry=txt - --txt-owner-id=my-identifier Use --dry-run if you want to be extra careful on the first run.

The TTL record can be set with the external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl node annotation.","title":"Configuring ExternalDNS to use Cluster Nodes as Source"},{"location":"tutorials/nodes/#manifest-for-cluster-without-rbac-enabled","text":"--- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: external-dns spec: strategy: type: Recreate selector: matchLabels: app: external-dns template: metadata: labels: app: external-dns spec: serviceAccountName: external-dns containers: - name: external-dns image: k8s.gcr.io/external-dns/external-dns:v0.10.2 args: - --source=node # will use nodes as source - --provider=aws - --zone-name-filter=external-dns-test.my-org.com # will make ExternalDNS see only the hosted zones matching provided domain, omit to process all available hosted zones - --domain-filter=external-dns-test.my-org.com - --aws-zone-type=public - --registry=txt - --fqdn-template={{.Name}}.external-dns-test.my-org.com - --txt-owner-id=my-identifier - --policy=sync - --log-level=debug","title":"Manifest (for cluster without RBAC enabled)"},{"location":"tutorials/nodes/#manifest-for-cluster-with-rbac-enabled","text":"apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: name: external-dns --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRole metadata: name: external-dns rules: - apiGroups: [\"route.openshift.io\"] resources: [\"routes\"] verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"] - apiGroups: [\"\"] resources: [\"services\",\"endpoints\",\"pods\"] verbs: [\"get\",\"watch\",\"list\"] - apiGroups: [\"extensions\",\"networking.k8s.io\"] resources: [\"ingresses\"] verbs: [\"get\",\"watch\",\"list\"] - apiGroups: [\"\"] resources: [\"nodes\"] verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"] --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: external-dns-viewer roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: external-dns subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: external-dns namespace: external-dns --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: external-dns spec: strategy: type: Recreate selector: matchLabels: app: external-dns template: metadata: labels: app: external-dns spec: serviceAccountName: external-dns containers: - name: external-dns image: k8s.gcr.io/external-dns/external-dns:v0.10.2 args: - --source=node # will use nodes as source - --provider=aws - --zone-name-filter=external-dns-test.my-org.com # will make ExternalDNS see only the hosted zones matching provided domain, omit to process all available hosted zones - --domain-filter=external-dns-test.my-org.com - --aws-zone-type=public - --registry=txt - --fqdn-template={{.Name}}.external-dns-test.my-org.com - --txt-owner-id=my-identifier - --policy=sync - --log-level=debug","title":"Manifest (for cluster with RBAC enabled)"},{"location":"tutorials/ns-record/","text":"Creating NS record with CRD source \u00b6 You can create NS records with the help of CRD source and DNSEndpoint CRD.

YMMV. Insecure Updates \u00b6 DNS-side configuration \u00b6 Create a DNS zone Enable insecure dynamic updates for the zone Enable Zone Transfers to all servers external-dns configuration \u00b6 You\u2019ll want to configure external-dns similarly to the following: ... - --provider=rfc2136 - --rfc2136-host=192.168.0.1 - --rfc2136-port=53 - --rfc2136-zone=k8s.example.org - --rfc2136-insecure - --rfc2136-tsig-axfr # needed to enable zone transfers, which is required for deletion of records. ... Secure Updates Using RFC3645 (GSS-TSIG) \u00b6 DNS-side configuration \u00b6 Create a DNS zone Enable secure dynamic updates for the zone Enable Zone Transfers to all servers If you see any error messages which indicate that external-dns was somehow not able to fetch existing DNS records from your DNS server, this could mean that you forgot about step 3. Kerberos Configuration \u00b6 DNS with secure updates relies upon a valid Kerberos configuration running within the external-dns container. At this time, you will need to create a ConfigMap for the external-dns container to use and mount it in your deployment. Below is an example of a working Kerberos configuration inside a ConfigMap definition. This may be different depending on many factors in your environment: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : creationTimestamp : null name : krb5.conf data : krb5.conf : | [logging] default = FILE:/var/log/krb5libs.log kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmind.log [libdefaults] dns_lookup_realm = false ticket_lifetime = 24h renew_lifetime = 7d forwardable = true rdns = false pkinit_anchors = /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt default_ccache_name = KEYRING:persistent:%{uid} default_realm = YOUR-REALM.COM [realms] YOUR-REALM.COM = { kdc = dc1.yourdomain.com admin_server = dc1.yourdomain.com } [domain_realm] yourdomain.com = YOUR-REALM.COM .yourdomain.com = YOUR-REALM.COM In most cases, the realm name will probably be the same as the domain name, so you can simply replace YOUR-REALM.COM with something like YOURDOMAIN.COM . Once the ConfigMap is created, the container external-dns container needs to be told to mount that ConfigMap as a volume at the default Kerberos configuration location. The pod spec should include a similar configuration to the following: ... volumeMounts : - mountPath : /etc/krb5.conf name : kerberos-config-volume subPath : krb5.conf ... volumes : - configMap : defaultMode : 420 name : krb5.conf name : kerberos-config-volume ... external-dns configuration \u00b6 You\u2019ll want to configure external-dns similarly to the following: ... - --provider=rfc2136 - --rfc2136-gss-tsig - --rfc2136-host=dns-host.yourdomain.com - --rfc2136-port=53 - --rfc2136-zone=your-zone.com - --rfc2136-kerberos-username=your-domain-account - --rfc2136-kerberos-password=your-domain-password - --rfc2136-kerberos-realm=your-domain.com - --rfc2136-tsig-axfr # needed to enable zone transfers, which is required for deletion of records. ... As noted above, the --rfc2136-kerberos-realm flag is completely optional and won\u2019t be necessary in many cases. Most likely, you will only need it if you see errors similar to this: KRB Error: (68) KDC_ERR_WRONG_REALM Reserved for future use . The flag --rfc2136-host can be set to the host\u2019s domain name or IP address. However, it also determines the name of the Kerberos principal which is used during authentication. This means that Active Directory might only work if this is set to a specific domain name, possibly leading to errors like this: KDC_ERR_S_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN Server not found in Kerberos database . To fix this, try setting --rfc2136-host to the \u201cactual\u201d hostname of your DNS server.","title":"Configuring RFC2136 provider"},{"location":"tutorials/rfc2136/#configuring-rfc2136-provider","text":"This tutorial describes how to use the RFC2136 with either BIND or Windows DNS.","title":"Configuring RFC2136 provider"},{"location":"tutorials/rfc2136/#using-with-bind","text":"To use external-dns with BIND: generate/procure a key, configure DNS and add a deployment of external-dns.","title":"Using with BIND"},{"location":"tutorials/rfc2136/#server-credentials","text":"RFC2136 was developed for and tested with BIND DNS server.
