Typically, you expose your deployment to the Internet by creating a Service with <code>type=LoadBalancer</code>. Depending on your environment, this usually assigns a random publicly available endpoint to your service that you can access from anywhere in the world. On Google Kubernetes Engine, this is a public IP address:</p> <pre><code>$ kubectl get svc\nNAME      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE\nnginx     10.3.249.226   35.187.104.85   80:32281/TCP   1m\n</code></pre> <p>But dealing with IPs for service discovery isn\u2019t nice, so you register this IP with your DNS provider under a better name\u2014most likely, one that corresponds to your service name. If the IP changes, you update the DNS record accordingly.</p> <p>Those times are over! ExternalDNS takes care of that last step for you by keeping your DNS records synchronized with your external entry points.</p> <p>ExternalDNS\u2019 usefulness also becomes clear when you use Ingresses to allow external traffic into your cluster. Via Ingress, you can tell Kubernetes to route traffic to different services based on certain HTTP request attributes, e.g. the Host header:</p> <pre><code>$ kubectl get ing\nNAME         HOSTS                                      ADDRESS         PORTS     AGE\nentrypoint   frontend.example.org,backend.example.org   35.186.250.78   80        1m\n</code></pre> <p>But there\u2019s nothing that actually makes clients resolve those hostnames to the Ingress\u2019 IP address.

The internal one should provision hostnames used on the internal network (perhaps inside a VPC), and the external one to expose DNS to the internet.</p> <p>To do this with ExternalDNS you can use the <code>--ingress-class</code> flag to specifically tie an instance of ExternalDNS to an instance of a ingress controller.

You can then start two ExternalDNS providers, one with <code>--ingress-class=internal</code> and one with <code>--ingress-class=external</code>.</p> <p>If you need to search for multiple ingress classes, you can specify the flag multiple times, like so: <code>--ingress-class=internal --ingress-class=external</code>.</p> <p>The <code>--ingress-class</code> flag will check both the <code>spec.ingressClassName</code> field and the deprecated <code>kubernetes.io/ingress.class</code> annotation.

In larger clusters with many resources which change frequently this can cause performance issues.

By preventing multiple instances from making changes concurrently, it avoids conflicts and reduces downtime, ensuring consistency across the cluster.</li> <li>Workload Running on Spot Instances: For workloads running on cost-effective but ephemeral spot instances, leader election is crucial for resiliency. When a spot instance running the leader is preempted, the failover process enables a standby instance to seamlessly take over leadership, ensuring continued execution of critical tasks.</li> <li>Requirement for Disaster Recovery: In disaster recovery scenarios, leader election provides fault tolerance by allowing another instance to take over when the primary leader becomes unavailable. This guarantees operational continuity even in the face of unexpected failures, supporting robust disaster recovery strategies.</li> <li>High Availability (HA) Scenarios: In highly available systems, leader election ensures that a single active leader manages essential processes or state, while backups remain ready to step in instantly in case of failure. This minimizes recovery time objectives (RTO) and eliminates single points of failure.</li> <li>Enhanced Reliability in Distributed Systems: Incorporating leader election into your distributed system enhances its overall reliability. It avoids the pitfalls of uncoordinated task execution, providing deterministic behavior and ensuring only one instance manages critical tasks at any given time.</li> <li>Conflict Prevention: Leader election serves as a guard against conflicts arising from multiple instances attempting to execute the same tasks. By ensuring that only the elected leader acts on shared resources or processes, it prevents data corruption, inconsistencies, and wasted computational effort.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"docs/proposal/002-internal-ipv6-handling-rollback/","title":"002 internal ipv6 handling rollback","text":"<pre><code>---\ntitle: \"Proposal: Rollback IPv6 internal Node IP exposure\"\nversion: if applicable\nauthors: @ivankatliarchuk, @szuecs, @mloiseleur\ncreation-date: 2025-01-01\nstatus: implemented\n---\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"docs/proposal/002-internal-ipv6-handling-rollback/#introduce-feature-flag-for-ipv6-internal-node-ip-handling-in-external-dns-and-change-the-behavior","title":"Introduce Feature Flag for IPv6 Internal Node IP Handling in \u2018\u2019external-dns\u2019\u2019 and Change the behavior","text":""},{"location":"docs/proposal/002-internal-ipv6-handling-rollback/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>This proposal aims to introduce a feature flag in \u2018external-dns\u2019 to control the handling of IPv6 internal node IPs.

The above example would result in two alias records (A and AAAA) being created for each of the domains: <code>echoserver.mycluster.example.org</code> and <code>echoserver.example.org</code>. All four records alias the ALB that is associated with the Ingress object.
