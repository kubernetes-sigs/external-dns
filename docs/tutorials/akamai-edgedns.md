# Setting up External-DNS for Services on Akamai Edge DNS

## Prerequisites

Akamai Edge DNS (formally known as Fast DNS) provider support was first released in External-DNS v0.5.18

### Zones

External-DNS manages service endpoints in existing DNS zones. The Akamai provider does not add, remove or configure new zones in anyway. Edge DNS zones can be created and managed thru the [Akamai Control Center](https://control.akamai.com) or [Akamai DevOps Tools](https://developer.akamai.com/devops), [Akamai CLI](https://developer.akamai.com/cli) and [Akamai Terraform Provider](https://developer.akamai.com/tools/integrations/terraform)

### Akamai Edge DNS Authentication

The Akamai Edge DNS provider requires valid Akamai Edgegrid API authentication credentials to access zones and manage associated DNS records. 

Credentials can be provided to the provider either directly by key or indirectly via a file. The Akamai credential keys and mappings to the Akamai provider utilizing different presentation methods are:

| Edgegrid Auth Key | External-DNS Cmd Line Key | Environment/ConfigMap Key | Description |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| host | akamai-serviceconsumerdomain | EXTERNAL_DNS_AKAMAI_SERVICECONSUMERDOMAIN | Akamai Edgegrid API server |
| access_token | akamai-access-token | EXTERNAL_DNS_AKAMAI_ACCESS_TOKEN | Akamai Edgegrid API access token |
| client_token | akamai-client-token  | EXTERNAL_DNS_AKAMAI_CLIENT_TOKEN |Akamai Edgegrid API client token |
| client-secret | akamai-client-secret | EXTERNAL_DNS_AKAMAI_CLIENT_SECRET |Akamai Edgegrid API client secret |

In addition to specifying auth credentials individually, the credentials may be referenced indirectly by using the Akamai Edgegrid .edgerc file convention.

| External-DNS Cmd Line | Environment/ConfigMap | Description |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| akamai-edgerc-path | EXTERNAL_DNS_AKAMAI_EDGERC_PATH | Accessible path to Edgegrid credentials file, e.g /home/test/.edgerc |
| akamai-edgerc-section | EXTERNAL_DNS_AKAMAI_EDGERC_SECTION | Section in Edgegrid credentials file containing credentials |

Note: akamai-edgerc-path and akamai-edgerc-section are present in External-DNS versions after v0.7.5

[Akamai API Authentication](https://developer.akamai.com/getting-started/edgegrid) provides an overview and further information pertaining to the generation of auth credentials for API base applications and tools.

The following example defines and references a Kubernetes ConfigMap secret, applied by referencing the secret and its keys in the env section of the deployment.


## Deploy External-DNS

An operational External-DNS deployment consists of an External-DNS container and service. The following sections demonstrate the ConfigMap objects that would make up an example functional external DNS kubernetes configuration utilizing NGINX as the exposed service.

Connect your `kubectl` client to the cluster with which you want to test External-DNS, and then apply one of the following manifest files for deployment:

### Manifest (for clusters without RBAC enabled)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: external-dns
spec:
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: external-dns
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: external-dns
    spec:

        args:
        - --source=service  # or ingress or both
        - --provider=akamai
        - --domain-filter=example.com
        # zone-id-filter may be specified as well to filter on contract ID
        - --registry=txt
        - --txt-owner-id={{ owner-id-for-this-external-dns }}
        env:
        - name: EXTERNAL_DNS_AKAMAI_SERVICECONSUMERDOMAIN
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: external-dns
              key: EXTERNAL_DNS_AKAMAI_SERVICECONSUMERDOMAIN
        - name: EXTERNAL_DNS_AKAMAI_CLIENT_TOKEN
          valueFrom:

          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: external-dns

```

          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:

          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:

              name: external-dns
              key: EXTERNAL_DNS_AKAMAI_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Create the deployment for External-DNS:

```
$ kubectl create -f externaldns.yaml
```

## Deploying an Nginx Service

Create a service file called 'nginx.yaml' with the following contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx
  annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: nginx.example.com
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl: "600" #optional
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

Create the deployment, service and ingress object:

```
$ kubectl create -f nginx.yaml
```

## Verify Akamai Edge DNS Records

It is recommended to wait 3-5 minutes before validating the records to allow the record changes to propagate to all the Akamai name servers worldwide.

The records can be validated using the [Akamai Control Center](http://control.akamai.com) or by executing a dig, nslookup or similar DNS command.
 
## Cleanup

Once you successfully configure and verify record management via External-DNS, you can delete the tutorial's example:

```
$ kubectl delete -f nginx.yaml
$ kubectl delete -f externaldns.yaml
```

## Additional Information

* The Akamai provider allows the administrative user to filter zones by both name (domain-filter) and contract Id (zone-id-filter). The Edge DNS API will return a '500 Internal Error' if an invalid contract Id is provided.
* The provider will substitute any embedded quotes in TXT records with `` ` `` (back tick) when writing the records to the API.
