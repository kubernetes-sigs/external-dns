# Configuring ExternalDNS to use Gateway API Route Sources

This describes how to configure ExternalDNS to use Gateway API Route sources.
It is meant to supplement the other provider-specific setup tutorials.

## Supported API Versions

As the Gateway API is still in an experimental phase, ExternalDNS makes no backwards
compatibilty guarantees regarding its support. However, it currently supports a mixture of
v1alpha2 and v1beta1 APIs. Gateways and HTTPRoutes are supported using the v1beta1 API.
GRPCRoutes, TLSRoutes, TCPRoutes, and UDPRoutes are supported using the v1alpha2 API.

## Hostnames

HTTPRoute and TLSRoute specs, along with their associated Gateway Listeners, contain hostnames that
will be used by ExternalDNS. However, no such hostnames may be specified in TCPRoute or UDPRoute
specs. For TCPRoutes and UDPRoutes, the `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname` annotation
is the recommended way to provide their hostnames to ExternalDNS. This annotation is also supported
for HTTPRoutes and TLSRoutes by ExternalDNS, but it's _strongly_ recommended that they use their
specs to provide all intended hostnames, since the Gateway that ultimately routes their
requests/connections won't recognize additional hostnames from the annotation.
