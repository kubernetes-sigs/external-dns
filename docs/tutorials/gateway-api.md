# Configuring ExternalDNS to use Gateway API Route Sources

This describes how to configure ExternalDNS to use Gateway API Route sources.
It is meant to supplement the other provider-specific setup tutorials.

## Supported API Versions

ExternalDNS currently supports a mixture of v1alpha2, v1beta1, v1 APIs.

Gateway API has two release channels: Standard and Experimental.
The Experimental channel includes v1alpha2, v1beta2, and v1 APIs.
The Standard channel only includes v1beta2 and v1 APIs, not v1alpha2.

TCPRoutes, TLSRoutes, and UDPRoutes only exist in v1alpha2 and continued support for
these versions is NOT guaranteed. At some time in the future, Gateway API will graduate
these Routes to v1. ExternalDNS will likely follow that upgrade and move to the v1 API,
where they will be available in the Standard release channel. This will be a breaking
change if your Experimental CRDs are not updated to include the new v1 API.

Gateways and HTTPRoutes are available in v1alpha2, v1beta1, and v1 APIs.
However, some notable environments are behind in upgrading their CRDs to include the v1 API.
For compatibility reasons Gateways and HTTPRoutes use the v1beta1 API.

GRPCRoutes are available in v1alpha2 and v1 APIs, not v1beta2.
Therefore, GRPCRoutes use the v1 API which is available in both release channels.
Unfortunately, this means they will not be available in environments with old CRDs.

## Hostnames

HTTPRoute and TLSRoute specs, along with their associated Gateway Listeners, contain hostnames that
will be used by ExternalDNS. However, no such hostnames may be specified in TCPRoute or UDPRoute
specs. For TCPRoutes and UDPRoutes, the `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname` annotation
is the recommended way to provide their hostnames to ExternalDNS. This annotation is also supported
for HTTPRoutes and TLSRoutes by ExternalDNS, but it's _strongly_ recommended that they use their
specs to provide all intended hostnames, since the Gateway that ultimately routes their
requests/connections won't recognize additional hostnames from the annotation.
