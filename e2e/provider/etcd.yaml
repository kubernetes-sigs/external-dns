  ## Ideally we would use SRV records to do peer discovery for initialization.
  ## Unfortunately discovery will not work without logic to wait for these to
  ## populate in the container. This problem is relatively easy to overcome by
  ## making changes to prevent the etcd process from starting until the records
  ## have populated. The documentation on statefulsets briefly talk about it.
