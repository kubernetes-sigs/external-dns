# Migrate Cloudflare provider from v0 to v5 API

## What type of PR is this?

/kind feature
/kind cleanup

## What this PR does / why we need it:

This PR migrates the Cloudflare provider from the deprecated `cloudflare-go` v0 API to the current v5 API, addressing the deprecation notice in https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go/issues/4155.

### Key Changes:

1. **Removed deprecated v0 dependency**: Completely removed `github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go v0.115.0`
2. **Updated to v5 API**: Now exclusively uses `github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go/v5 v5.1.0`
3. **Refactored Custom Hostnames**: Migrated from v0 pagination to v5 auto-paging API
4. **Improved error handling**: Simplified error handling while maintaining rate limit detection
5. **Enhanced test coverage**: Increased coverage from 89.2% to 92.4%

### Benefits:

- ✅ **Security**: Using actively maintained API version
- ✅ **Compatibility**: Aligned with Cloudflare's current recommendations
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Single API version, reduced complexity
- ✅ **Performance**: Leverages v5's improved auto-pagination
- ✅ **Regional Hostnames**: Maintained 100% test coverage for data localization features

## Which issue(s) this PR fixes:

Related to the deprecation notice: https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go/issues/4155

## Special notes for your reviewer:

### Breaking Changes:

1. **Error Handling**: Server errors (5xx) are no longer automatically converted to soft errors. Only rate limit errors (429, "rate limit" messages) are treated as soft errors. This aligns with v5 API behavior.

2. **Credentials Validation**: The provider now validates credentials during initialization and fails fast if neither token nor API key/email are provided.

3. **Custom Hostnames API**: Simplified pagination handling - v5 API manages pagination automatically.

### Test Coverage:

- **Overall**: 92.4% coverage (up from 89.2%)
- **Regional Hostnames**: 100% coverage maintained
- **New Tests**: Added comprehensive Custom Hostnames tests in `cloudflare_customhostname_test.go`

All existing tests pass with the new v5 implementation.

## Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?

```release-note
Cloudflare provider: Migrated from deprecated v0 API to v5 API. Behavior remains the same for most users. Note: Server errors (5xx) from Cloudflare API are no longer automatically retried as soft errors; only rate limit errors are treated as soft errors.
