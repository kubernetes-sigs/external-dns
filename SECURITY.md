# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Oracle values the independent security research community and believes that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of all our users.

Please do NOT raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to secalert_us@oracle.com preferably with a proof of concept. We provide additional information on [how to report security vulnerabilities to Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/reporting.html) which includes public encryption keys for secure email.

We ask that you do not use other channels or contact project contributors directly. 

Non-vulnerability related security issues such as new great new ideas for security features are welcome on GitHub Issues. 

## Security Updates, Alerts and Bulletins

Security updates will be released on a regular cadence. Many of our projects will typically release security fixes in conjunction with the [Oracle Critical Patch Update](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) program. Security updates are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. A pre-release announcement will be published on the Thursday preceding each release. Additional information, including past advisories, is available on our [Security Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) page.

## Security-Related Information

We will provide security related information such as a threat model, considerations for secure use, or any known security issues in our documentation. Please note that labs and sample code are intended to demonstrate a concept and may not be sufficiently hardened for production use.
